# California Unlicensed Housing Compliance Binder

## Purpose of This Binder

This compliance binder provides a comprehensive guide for operators of unlicensed residential care facilities in California. It covers regulatory requirements, fair housing compliance, and best practices for providing quality care while maintaining legal compliance.

## Regulatory Authority

### State Licensing Agency
The California Department of Health and Human Services oversees the regulation of residential care facilities. For unlicensed facilities (typically serving 3 or fewer residents), operators must still comply with certain regulations.

### Key Contact Information
- State Licensing Board: Contact your local state office
- Fair Housing Office: HUD regional office
- Ombudsman Program: State long-term care ombudsman

## Licensed vs. Unlicensed Care Categories

### Licensed Facilities (for reference)
In California, facilities serving more than a specified number of residents typically require state licensure. This includes:
- Adult Foster Care (AFC)
- Assisted Living Facilities (ALF)
- Group Homes

### Unlicensed Facilities (this binder's focus)
Facilities serving 3 or fewer unrelated adults may operate without a state license in many cases, but must still comply with:
- Local zoning ordinances
- Building and fire safety codes
- Fair Housing Act requirements
- Basic health and safety standards

## Fair Housing Act Compliance

### Overview
The Fair Housing Act (FHA) prohibits discrimination in housing based on:
- Race, color, religion, national origin
- Sex, familial status
- Disability (including mental illness and substance use disorders)

### Reasonable Accommodations
Operators must provide reasonable accommodations to residents with disabilities. This may include:
- Modified policies or procedures
- Physical accessibility modifications

### Reasonable Modifications
Residents may request reasonable modifications to the physical premises at their own expense, unless the facility receives federal financial assistance.
