### PERFORMANCE LIABILITY + WARRIOR TEMPERAMENT

**Your Protocol: "The Warrior's Activation"**

#### Practice 1: Potential-to-Action Bridge (20 minutes, daily)
**Why This Rewires the Pattern**: Warriors close gaps through movement. Converting one potential into one action daily bridges the gap.

**How to Do It**:
1. Morning: Identify one capability not being used
   - Skill sitting dormant
   - Knowledge not applied
   - Strength not leveraged
2. Ask: "What's ONE action that uses this potential TODAY?"
3. Make it specific and completable:
   - "I have sales skill → I'll make 3 calls today"
   - "I have writing ability → I'll write 500 words today"
4. Set 60-minute execution window
5. Use the potential within that window
6. Track: Daily potential activated
7. Celebrate: Potential → Action conversion

**Expected Outcome**: Daily action closes potential gap. Unused capability becomes active contribution.

---

#### Practice 2: Performance Benchmark Walk (20 minutes, 3x/week)
**Why This Rewires the Pattern**: Walking while envisioning peak performance trains nervous system for full capacity. Movement embodies potential.

**How to Do It**:
1. Walk with confidence and power
2. Visualize performing at full capacity:
   - Using all your skills
   - Operating at peak capability
   - Results matching potential
3. Feel in body what full activation feels like
4. Notice resistance or excitement
5. Ask while walking: "What's stopping full activation?"
6. Let movement reveal blocks
7. End with declaration: "I activate my full potential"

**Expected Outcome**: Physical rehearsal of full capacity. Nervous system trained for peak performance.

---

#### Practice 3: Capability Inventory Action (30 minutes, weekly)
**Why This Rewires the Pattern**: Warriors need tactical deployment. Identifying unused capabilities creates action plan for activation.

   - Connections not leveraged
2. For each, ask: "Why am I not using this?"
3. Identify blocks: Fear? Timing? Not seeing opportunity?
4. Choose 3 capabilities to activate this week
5. Create specific action for each:
   - "Use [skill] by [specific action] on [day]"
6. Execute all 3 within week
7. Track activation rate
