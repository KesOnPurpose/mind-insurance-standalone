Group home for Newbies Q\&A 7:4:25  
In this lecture, I'm going to talk about the concept of the differential equation. OK, group  
homes is an exit strategy that real estate investors utilize to serve the community while  
simultaneously increasing net profit. OK, secondly, on top of that, the other thing that you need  
to know is when doing something like this, you are going to have to have the heart to do it.  
And the reason that I say that is because this is going if you if this is your first time in  
entrepreneurship, get ready for a never ending test. If you've been in entrepreneurship and  
you understand what comes with entrepreneurship, but this is your first time within this  
industry. Get ready for a bigger test, because now you are working with multiple personalities  
that come from all different backgrounds that will test you in different ways that you haven't  
been tested.  
And it's a gift. OK, I want you guys to know that part. This is a gift to be able to choose yourself  
for this route.  
So don't look at it as any other type of way. This is a gift. And it is the gift that will allow you to  
open presence every day with your presence, with your acuity to the to the to the knowledge  
that you're going to need to have and to this community as well.  
Because you have every time when I tell you, you have everything that you need right here  
within this community. You have everything that you need. You have the business coaching.  
You have mindset coaching. You have sales coaching. You have the different demographics  
coachings for the different people that you're going to serve and everything that Ned is going  
to bring to the table as well.  
So you will often hear me come on here and talk about mindset, because I know at the end of  
the day that it sucks sometimes. So whenever you're feeling like that and I feel that you're  
feeling like that, I'm just going to come give you a soft nudge and a hard correction to make  
sure that you keep going forward on the path. Back to you, Ned.  
All right. And one of my other partners just jumped on. Mikel, are you able to introduce  
yourself? Absolutely.  
Hello, everyone. I'm Mikel. Some of you may know me, some of you may not.  
I have been traveling the circuit, so to speak, with Lynette. And I am a full time real estate  
investor. I am a group home investor.  
I was once. Well, let me say this. I am a full time real estate investor who uses group homes as  
an extra strategy.  
I prefer to invest in other people's group homes. My partner and I, Dion Lewis, we are lookingto have partners in the group home space. I am a capital raiser, a connector.  
I like to solve problems and I like to get paid for solving problems. Also, I'm primarily in the  
Atlanta market. We're in Atlanta market, Charlotte market, South Carolina and Houston.  
And we our specialty in real estate is helping people out of full foreclosure situation. We buy  
subject sub to properties and we convert them into real estate. We convert them into group  
homes or utilize the group home strategy.  
We're now looking to do more in Houston, which we will be purchasing the properties to  
convert into licensed group home where we will put in all of the the fire suppression systems  
and everything that the house need and then possibly rent it out to licensed group home  
owners. That's what we're looking to do. Let me see what else.  
We are considered the experts in the group, along with Don, Brandon, Tevin, Will, and a net  
circle of experts. And we love just pouring into to to the people here in the group. As Don said,  
there's a lot of free resources in the group that we love to share.  
We do the zooms. We do. We answer the questions.  
Lynette has provided a platform where basically any question that you need answered. You  
could just go into the search bar and find the answer for it. Right.  
Other than that. I know about your. Let's say I am kind of like an event planner, so to speak,  
which we try to where we're looking to go to more cities and do smaller meetups to be more  
intimate with our cousins in the group.  
So we have a meetup coming up in July on July 17th here in Atlanta, where one of my partners,  
a dear friend of mine, like a brother, Lester Young will be coming to speak on reentry and the  
importance of reentry housing. We will also have Lynette as a featured speaker. She's coming  
and she will be talking about how to start a referral agency, because what we see in the group  
is a lot of people say, I don't have any money.  
I don't know where to start. Find a house. Also, you could actually become a placement  
consultant where you're actually going out and doing all the marketing and getting connections  
with all these agencies and then taking that connection with these agencies.  
And when they send you referrals, refer them out. And if you're making two or three or four  
referrals per day, you're making sometimes anywhere from a thousand to fifteen hundred  
dollars a day. After about a month of doing that, I mean, there's no way you can say that you  
don't have enough money to actually purchase, to lease a home or even purchase a home  
using the sub two model for us or owner finance, some type of creative financing model.  
So we're having that event here and we're inviting our community leaders, community leaders  
in the affordable housing space. So there will be great connections there, but also for those ofus in the Atlanta market and not even in the Atlanta market, but people that are in other  
markets where we could connect with one another and have that conversation where we could  
assist each other by doing referrals or learning more and asking Lynette questions, even about  
the re-entry and gaining more knowledge in that area. So, again, that's July 17th here in Atlanta.  
If you DM me, I can send you the link if you're interested in attending. OK, so, yeah, I look  
forward to seeing you guys. And again, it's just we can consider this as a part of the continual  
education, right? Because we need more of these in-person meetups where we're meeting with  
people of like mind doing the same thing in the same arena that we're doing where we're  
operating and where we can increase our knowledge and our connection with one another.  
So that's who I am. If you have any questions, you can put it in the chat or send me a DM. Put a  
three in a chat if you are in the state of Georgia.  
Put a three in a chat if you're in the state of Georgia. I see one of my other partners is here.  
Hey, Idris.  
Hey, what's up? What you got going over there in Atlanta stealing all the money at the group  
home? Give me some. Actually, I was just dropping some clothes and shoes off for some people  
who need it. So that's what I'm doing right now, as a matter of fact.  
So let me jump on in to what's going on. But I'm excited about that event that y'all are doing.  
Everybody who's on this on this Zoom tonight.  
This is a Q\&A, so I encourage every single one of you. Ask, ask your question. This is the chance  
that you have to ask your question.  
And you're going to get one on one actual advice from that. I think Don is up here. We may be  
up here.  
You just have a whole host of experts up here who know the ins and outs of being successful in  
this business. So no one should leave without having any questions answered tonight. So make  
sure that you take more important than that.  
Most important thing that you can do is I want you to just one thing that you learn tonight and  
go out and execute it. Just execute on one thing that you learn tonight. That's the most  
important thing that you can do.  
You can learn all this information. It means nothing whatsoever. If you don't go out and  
execute and implement the most important thing that you can execute and implement, as a  
matter of fact, is picking up that phone and establishing a relationship with somebody who  
could send you a referral.  
Going out and maybe meeting someone, maybe going out to some of these. There's going to  
be all kind of Independence Day and all kind of stuff going on this weekend. Go out and meetsome people.  
Put yourself in a position to where you're going to be able to win. And what's the most  
important thing is establishing relationships, getting out there, meeting people who may need  
housing, people who can refer people for housing. I had a meeting.  
It was yesterday. It was a Zoom yesterday with a she's director of social services at Sandy  
Springs Nursing. Basically, they do rehabilitative services.  
And her big thing was, I'm so grateful that I was able to establish a connection with you. As a  
matter of fact, we have someone right now that we need to transfer out. We don't have  
anywhere for him to go because his insurance stopped paying or whatever.  
So there's a huge need. And right now, everybody wants that big bill, whatever the hell it's  
called. But with that being said.  
That's really not going to affect a lot of us. As a matter of fact, what it may do is it's going to  
increase the demand. I was reading today the Atlanta Housing Authority.  
They're cutting 80 million dollars from their budget because the feds are whatever's going on.  
Whatever the feds are giving them, 80 million dollars in a lot that has to do with housing. So  
right now is a wonderful time to be in this to be in this business.  
But let's just go out. Let's just make the third and fourth quarter the stepping stone that we  
need so we can have the most successful year possible. All right.  
All right. So y'all hear from the team. Now we've been here from you all.  
So what I prefer you to do, if you have a question, hit the raised up the hand emoji. And let's  
talk because I don't really feel like reading right now. So if you've got a question, raise your  
hand, ask your question and I'll answer it.  
We'll be taking care of stuff in the chat to know what you got, Miss Tiffany long. OK. Done.  
OK. Hello, everyone. Hey, Nat.  
So I just made a connection with like a survivor group here locally. And she was just basically  
like she got the check ready to cut next week. If I'm able to house the individuals, she said that  
she's willing to pay like Airbnb prices or whatever, because I told I had short term rentals.  
So she says she's willing to pay the Airbnb prices, but they don't book through Airbnb. They  
book directly through me. So with that being said, I don't I don't want to come off as being  
greedy.  
But for one of my units, it's going for like six thousand dollars off Airbnb right now. So that  
would be more than what I would be making at like eight hundred dollars per bed for thatthree unit. The three bedroom.  
What's your confusion? So would I would it be OK, you know, and not sound greedy for  
overcharging or anything, you know, at just giving them that six thousand dollar rate? Does she  
know what your rates are listed for on Airbnb? No, I have not sent her the link. I told her we'll  
touch bases next week. Yeah, I would do it just like that, because essentially you just couldn't  
have the middleman.  
OK, I don't want to do it with Airbnb. No way. OK, I will use Airbnb is just a marketing tool.  
And when I get people in my house, I, you know, with a pitch to them. OK, OK, sounds good.  
Thank you.  
You're welcome. Hey, Courtney, James, how you doing? I'm fine. Thank you for asking.  
Yes, ma'am. So I just had a quick question. So I work while I used to work in juvenile corrections  
out in like Virginia area, Chesterfield.  
We only have like one like juvenile correction facility. When I did work there, I was a counselor.  
So I literally saw the need for like the guys that were aging.  
And the girls, too, because we had girls, the guys that were aging out maybe at 21 or  
sometimes 18\. And like you said, a lot of our S.O. they were able to go nowhere because people  
don't want to house them or whatever. So I know the need is there.  
I'm just trying to figure out, is the model a little bit different when it comes to funding? When  
you're dealing with people that are like, I wouldn't want to take them under 18 because I want  
to be able to be graduated already by the end or whatever. But is the model a little different  
being that they don't like I would imagine they wouldn't have like SSI or whatever other funding  
that you usually would use? Yes. So if I if it were me.  
I would. What state are you in? I live in South Carolina right now, but I'm sick of South Carolina.  
So I'm going back to Virginia like next month.  
What I would do is I would research what you all state do as far as aged out and be the housing  
provider. They house people who are aged out of foster care with a with a background as such.  
And, you know, so that also there are people who aged out with that charge who will have  
guaranteed income as well.  
OK, so you don't I don't know if you would notice, but a lot of people have been telling me that  
it needs to be like license in order to get funded. And obviously that's not true if you're doing it,  
but you don't think it will be. I guess better being there younger or no, it doesn't really matter  
the age.  
Yeah. What will be better? Like the license, like being licensed, starting license or unlicensed,  
because I've looked at the licensing process and it is pretty lengthy and it is pretty costly. So Ibelieve just from my thought process that it may be easier to start unlicensed.  
And if I want to go into being licensed, you know, transitioning to that. But does the age matter  
when it comes to your facility being licensed or unlicensed? Next year, go ahead, we'll. What are  
we talking about, reentry or youth? We're talking about age.  
They're both actually. I mean, they technically use depending on, I guess, how you look,  
because some of them be 17 and they get kicked out because they were not kicked out. But,  
you know, maybe their sentence is over.  
Some of them, they've done all their treatment, so they have to they can leave, but they don't  
have anywhere to go. Some of them, you know, their parents like, yeah, I'm not dealing with  
that because you've got locked up too many times and I don't want you to come back in here.  
So technically they are reintegrated into society, but they're also youth because they could be  
18, 19, 20, 21, depending on, you know, whatever the situation is.  
I'm sorry. And what was your concern? I was trying to figure out what it be. Does licensing  
matter when it comes to like age or does it matter if they go to a license facility or not? Because  
it just doesn't matter.  
Well, I mean, like I said, you can research on your state website to see what's needed. But if we  
talk about youth, that's 18 to in different states, it go to a different range of people. So like here  
in Texas, 18 to 22, you got some as 18 and 24, 26\.  
So it's different, but they are adults. So typically they don't require you to have a license, but  
you may have to be contracted with the state to be able to house those individuals. And then, of  
course, it is some people that are in like juvenile or was in that little prison system, maybe not  
the penitentiary per se, but they can come home and be able to be placed in these homes.  
But it is really going to boil down to what you actually want to do in a popular centers. You're  
breaking up now. I mean, you hear me? Yeah.  
OK. I don't even know what you heard, but if you want to do it, are you trying to do it? Like  
coming out the foster system and strictly out of that juvenile correctional facility or that we we  
used to do, like the kids that come out of they have like detention home, anything with DJJ,  
pretty much all the kids that are in DJJ at the age they do their offense and they are they are  
transitioning back into the community. Yeah.  
So that's a little tricky because if they come out of the system and they 18 and older. They're  
more than likely not coming out into any type of program unless your state has some specific  
program, like through a nonprofit or something like that. But let's say if you're trying to do like  
17 year old and under.  
So there are people who are in the juvenile detention that can that you can place into your  
youth group home. That's actually a policy and procedure that I'm getting ready to put intoMars to be able to market to that population as well here in Texas, whenever I get my youth  
group home up and running. So I think if you want to serve re-entry as a whole as an adult, you  
probably just going to have to figure out if they will allow you to do it like here how we do it  
here in Texas.  
So, like, we don't technically have to have a halfway house or those certain certifications that  
people want. We can really just call the caseworkers at the prison and stuff and try to get them  
in a home. But here's the thing.  
Those people who come home that you're trying to shoot for. And it's you know, the question  
is, do they have funds to be able to pay their way? Unless. Right.  
And that's what I was trying to that. That's my concern. Because where are you going with your  
money? Yeah.  
So I would if you want to do like a style foster anybody that is strictly in the foster system or  
they in that residential treatment center. But still a part of the state's care of some sort, you  
most definitely can do that. But remember, people who get into that extended waiver program  
after they age out at 18, not everybody can go on it.  
They have to get qualified for that. So you have to have been doing good. You have to go to  
school.  
You have to have a job. So it's so many different qualifications. So I would kind of like back up  
and just kind of like do a little bit more research so you can be exposed to exactly want to do  
what you want to do.  
But if you want to do youth, just figure out what your state is telling you to do as far as youth.  
And don't try to tie it into reentry right now. Just keep it at foster youth or anybody within that  
state program ownership.  
Thank you, baby. All right. Courtney James.  
Yes, ma'am. Oh, that was you. OK, Miss Kia.  
Yes, ma'am. Thank you for this opportunity. My question is regarding the first 90 days, the first  
90 days of opening your group home.  
Have you noticed any mistakes that you've made within the first 90 days of opening? Oh, yeah. I  
made a whole lot of mistakes. Is there a specific piece of the business that you are looking to  
get some more insight on as far as a mistake is concerned? How about.  
Well, it wouldn't have anything to do with zoning. Just that you a mistake that you've made that  
you would not make again, that could have, like, impacted your whole business. Could it be  
something regarding your clients? How do you get paid? Girls.One of my biggest mistakes when I got started was not understanding how to properly assess  
someone before bringing them into the home. Trusting the social workers to know who I  
accept. So basically, let's just say, for instance, I tell a social worker from a behavior hospital  
that I only accept people with mild to moderate behaviors.  
And when they send me a lead, I take them based on knowing, trusting that they knew who I  
would be able to accept. And learning that social workers are not always on the housing  
provider side because they have to discharge a patient. Once the insurance stop paying, they  
have to get rid of their bed.  
And so they're going to be the spokesman, the salesman for any patient inside the hospital to  
convince you to take them. So knowing how to assess someone before bringing them into my  
home and not relying on and not trusting the social workers to give me the good and the bad  
and the ugly when it comes to the person that they're referring to me. OK, thank you for that.  
That's very important. OK, thank you. You're welcome.  
Miss Loriana Jean, Miss Loriana, you still got a question? I do. I'm sorry it took me so long to  
unmute myself. Are you OK? Good evening, everybody.  
So two things before I ask my question real quick, the young lady who had a question about the  
Airbnb, they don't pay your price. Send it to them. It's not being greedy.  
And I'm just saying that because I'm an Airbnb host in Florida and they don't pay. But at any  
rate, I wanted to know. So for the people who are coming out who have the funds, do you  
become their assignee? I know that's the thing.  
But you have to actually go through Social Security Administration to become an assignee. Or  
do you just do it as if it is independent living and they're responsible to pay for their rent on the  
first or to the fifth, like a regular lease? Does that make sense? Yeah. So for me, what you're  
talking about is becoming someone's representative payee or signing your company up as an  
organizational payee with Social Security.  
So for me, I don't like to do the payee thing. I want to have people who are responsible adults  
that's going to pay their rent. You have to also understand that you can't just force people to  
allow you to be their representative or organizational payee.  
They have to have a physician to sign off stating why they cannot manage their money on their  
own. And typically is more so if people have cognitive impairments or people who are physically  
disabled, immobile and can't go out and handle their personal funds. So they don't just allow  
you people to just turn over their checks to you.  
You have it has to be a reason. And like I said, ideally. I don't want to become everyone's payee  
because it is a process.And if you need to remove that person from the home, you still are financially responsible for  
their money and they can't have access to it until you go out to Social Security to remove  
yourself as a payee. And they have to find someone else to be over their check. Because once  
you put someone on status with Social Security is needing to have a payee, they have to have a  
physician to take them off of there.  
So that's the reason why I don't do it. OK, so it's not as easy as a process. It's people make it  
seem long story short.  
They just not going to let random strangers come in being taken over somebody's check. OK.  
Do you have any experience with Florida in specific? Because I am in North Florida.  
I currently have several properties, but some of them are Airbnb. And then some of them we  
actually have partnered up with an agency that does children that are aging out of foster care.  
But they they rent it from us and then they rent it to the to the kids.  
Right. And I consider them kids, but they want to be called young adults. So to the young adults  
in Florida.  
But for us, we are wanting to once that lease is over to go ahead and pivot and do our own  
thing, because I think that we're just more concerned about having more of a handle on it in  
the state of Florida. I'm not familiar with how it is when you're dealing with people that are  
coming out of the actual prison system. Do you have any experience with the floor with Florida?  
Is it as fluid as Texas? Yeah, I mean, every state has their own process of.  
Allowing individuals back into the community. I know a lady I can't think of her name. We just  
spoke.  
I don't know if you was on when I asked her about the probation parole officer position she had  
in Florida. Were you on? No, ma'am. OK.  
The probation parole officer in Florida. Can you unmute really quickly? Hopefully she's still on.  
Well, the process.  
Of getting people from return, you know, returning home. The need is always there for anyone  
who's coming home from prison and they don't have a place to stay. So you would just have to  
connect with a reentry team.  
The reentry team in your state. In order to provide the housing for them. So in our states,  
people who are returning home from prison have a barrier of housing because they have a  
background.  
And most times landlords or property, property management companies, apartment  
companies will run a background and not approve them. So the need is there. You have to  
connect with the ones for me.I house the ones with guaranteed income. And so that's what I'm going over on my webinar  
tomorrow and Sunday and Tuesday. OK.  
And one more quick thing. Do you have any experience with layering services? I think I'm  
asking it correctly. Yeah, because basically wraparound services getting paid off for one person  
multiple times.  
Yes. Because if you license through, well, in the state of Florida, you may have ADP or you have  
or something like that, where you could provide certain services if they have Medicaid or if they  
have Medicare that's being provided underneath your, your umbrella, you can build an  
insurance company separately for that. Yeah, that's I, I'm familiar with that.  
OK. Is that something that you would say is a good thing or is a bad thing? Everybody should  
position themselves to be able to get paid anywhere between five to six times out for the  
residents in their home, because that's how you make them, you know, more money without  
having to deal with a volume of people. OK.  
All right. Thank you. I was just making sure my mind wasn't all over the place.  
No, I wasn't doing too much. No, that's the way to go. OK, thank you.  
You're welcome. Hi, this is Erica. I'm here.  
I'm sorry. Was there a question probation? Yeah, I was. She was asking me about basically the  
guys who are returning home.  
Is there some basically the need there in Florida? And I was letting her know the need for  
people who are returning citizens is there for all states. You just have to navigate it differently  
through the reentry departments who handle those individuals returning home. Correct.  
Yes. Unless they have guaranteed income, they're basically supported by families. And a lot of  
times families will put the bill for them to live somewhere and then you can provide a service  
that way.  
But there is no funding otherwise because we don't have halfway houses. That's not something  
that is common in Florida. And since it ain't common, that's where the money resides.  
Yes, that's what exactly. If you don't mind me asking, what part of Florida are you in? Central  
Florida. OK.  
OK. I mean, I'm in Leon County. All right.  
OK. All right. Thank you.  
Thank you, Erica. Hey, Miss Roberta. Hello.  
So I have I have been having this pondering question because Cincinnati, Ohio, is known to be aconservative state. And it's like I hear when you talk about, you know, the residents in your  
home. You always talk about her and you know how good he is and stuff.  
And I'm and I be nervous, like wondering because so I have a boys group home for everybody.  
Don't know. And during my training, I always tell my staff that be careful how you treat and talk  
to these kids because they're going to be adults one day.  
You know, you see stuff on the news about how people be, you know, find the people doing  
stuff to people, stuff like that. So with these people coming from prison and stuff like. It's just  
like I always be wondering, like, you know, even though they may sound good through the  
assessment and stuff like that, and they say they're ready to come home.  
Like, what are your experience or do you have any experience or do anybody can share their  
experience? Like if somebody come, they bring them to their house and stuff and, you know,  
they don't be a good fit. And I just like, how do you handle like getting people out and like just  
keeping the community safe or, you know. So two things.  
Number one. 80 percent of people that I bring home from prison are seniors. They slow down.  
They don't have a lot of energy to be carrying on. Number two, 90 percent of them that I bring  
home are on community supervision. So if they mess up, they can go back to prison.  
And their parole officer is someone who I can contact if there is being some issues in the house.  
So I have that extra support. And also when somebody is released on community supervision,  
understand that they are still a property of the state.  
They are in the community, but the state can snatch that freedom away. So they don't come  
out, you know, wanting to go back in. And if that is the case, you know, that's what the parole  
officer is there for.  
They'll issue a warrant and come get them same day. OK. OK.  
So can I, should I. So I'm looking to close on this property. And the property is like in a, you  
know, a middle class when I rode through there. I said it was like some older, like white people,  
kids were riding around on their bikes and stuff.  
And I was like, I don't know if I should bring this community in here in this community or not.  
Or does that. I don't know.  
I have you. I don't know. Have you ever had to like, you know.  
Make sure that they were in the right community, but not like making them feel like they need  
to be in a dumps or something. I'm just, I don't know. I want the people that, I mean, once I buy  
this house and then they start petitioning to get me up out of there and all that stuff.  
Yeah. So for me. Here's here's my here's my take on it.And if anybody else have a different opinion, feel free to voice that. My take on it is. The  
neighborhood matters where it comes to, you know, staging these homes in a different  
populations that you look in the house.  
When people pay, go out and get a mortgage and put themselves in like a suburban area,  
upper class area, or even middle class. When they try to move them themselves and their family  
out the hood or the economical friendly areas, they're paying to be away from a certain caliber  
of people. So just to avoid all of that, I make sure that all of my homes are socially accepted in  
that kind of area.  
So where people are panhandling, people are, you know, don't. So you see a lot of people  
walking. Those areas are not going to dispute you having their home in the area, whereas if  
somebody, you know, feel like they finally made it and get themselves away from a certain  
caliber of people.  
And, you know, put it in, you know, put it next door to them, there may be issues. So not that  
it's right or not that it's wrong. Well, it is wrong.  
So not that it's right. But you can understand why people, you know, behave the way that they  
do, because they're working hard to be in a different environment and away from certain  
people. So you will put yourself in a situation if you do it.  
And so I wouldn't it'll be a headache for you, you know, fighting against it. Now, what I can say  
is, depending on the caliber of people, like I say, if you bring it in returning citizens. They are  
seniors, you have certain structures for them.  
So let's just say, for instance, if you have programs in place or somebody was asking about  
different wraparound services, one of one wraparound services like adult daycare, right, adult  
daycare. Let's just say, for instance, Monday through Friday, you get to get adult daycare to pick  
everybody up, take them, they gone for the day. Come back at night and they settle.  
No, no parlaying on the outside of the house in the front house. Any type of congregate has to  
be done in the backyard. Basically, you know.  
Being out of sight, out of mind instead of, you know, bringing that eyesore to the  
neighborhood. So it's a way to do it. You just have to have a structure in place on how you want  
to run your home to keep your neighbors happy.  
That makes sense. And I am in the process of getting accredited or certified or whatever for  
adult day program. So that that that do make a lot of sense.  
I think that makes me feel better. You welcome. And I also know that there's people who come  
from prison.  
You know, they they've been locked up, but they bougie. They high class to now. So you theyknow how to act in certain areas is to be more so people who have like those mental health  
challenges.  
You know, they cut up. But if you get someone who's saying. So they don't give you no  
problems.  
OK, thanks. You're welcome. Hey, Miss Graves, Miss Brown.  
Yes. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes.  
Hello, everyone. Thanks for having me. My question is, I am limited on time, but I've been  
following your route for about a year and a half.  
And I'm placed myself in a position to go for funding for property. And I'm just wondering how I  
could possibly connect with one of you guys to possibly get. Mentorship, so to speak.  
Well, are you still accepting new mentees? Only one more for the next 30 to 45 days. And where  
were you at anyway? Family house. Like your group of new because of your biological.  
No, my family. Oh, OK. So we'll put your information in the chat.  
OK. Who was it? Miss Brown. Yes.  
Yes. And will you say you located? I am in Maryland right now. But willing to relocate to start my  
business.  
That's it. Yes. OK.  
Yeah, we can help you. He could jump on a call and see what your goals are and see if y'all can  
work together. OK.  
Thank you, guys. You're welcome. Hey, Miss Brooks.  
Hi. How are you doing? I'm fine. How are you? Oh, no, not Angela.  
OK, I'm sorry. Let me get back on. Hi, I'm sorry.  
Hi, Miss Lynette. I have two questions tonight. My first question is, um, if you have S.O. Do they  
have to register? And if they have to register, what is the process of them registering as a S.O.  
when they come out of the when they do the reentry program? Yes.  
So what state are you in? Louisiana. OK, so every state is different when it comes to  
registration. So you have to look up the laws in in Louisiana to see what the you know, what  
people have to do.  
If you I can give you an idea based on Texas. So, for instance, if someone is a registered sex  
offender. They would have to go to the police department and register your address, whereveraddress they live in it, they have to register every year.  
They also have to if they are on parole, they have to register every year. They have to go to a  
treatment class once a week. And there are some some some rules as far as like 500 feet from  
daycares, parks, bus stops, schools, playgrounds and things like that.  
And I think if they're if they're a child sex offender. It's a thousand. No, one is a thousand one of  
500\.  
I don't know about heart right now, but you'll have to learn what your state say as far as like  
where they can live, what the registration process is and what it is for them to stay in  
compliance. Now, in the state of Texas, if they are not on parole, they don't have to adhere to  
the 500 1000 feet foot rule, nor do they have to go to the treatment classes. They just have to  
register once a year, but they can live wherever they want to live.  
OK, so I'm wondering if you would have to notify the individuals in the community. More so a  
local ordinance if they have one. So you will have to look up your state laws as well as any local  
ordinance they have against people who have six six related crimes.  
OK. All right. So that's what that'll be my assignment for this week.  
And also my other question. So I have a gentleman that's I have two individuals that  
approached me last week. One individual, he has properties of his own that he doesn't have  
time to manage them himself.  
So he was asking me if I would help him to fill fill the homes and help him to manage to  
manage the group homes. And then I had another guy. He already has a home and he's ready  
to just basically walk away from the home.  
He just gets he's burned out or whatever. And he already has tenants in there. And he's asking  
me to help him to manage the home as well.  
So my question is, what would be a fair price for me to give them to help them to do this? Three  
hundred dollars over a mortgage or rent. Asking rent. OK, so like if they're paying fifteen  
hundred, just ask them for three hundred.  
Right. Well, can you can you explain because I don't want to make a mess it up. So if the market  
if the market rate is going for twenty two hundred dollars, I will offer them twenty five hundred.  
So I would charge them twenty five hundred. No. What I'm saying is.  
If they want you to essentially fill up a house, run the house, all they're asking is, is the landlord.  
I'm only paying you three hundred dollars more than the market rate. I'm not I'm not an  
employee.  
I'm not running your business. I will rent the space around my business. No, no, no, no, no.OK, I think I explained. Well, yeah, you explained it right. They want you to fill the house and  
manage the house.  
Yeah. Well, one guy has what he wants. Essentially, you're working for them.  
OK, so you don't want to do that. If the only partnerships you should be willing to do is if they  
want to allow you to use their house so they they can cash flow their real estate, then. Offer  
them three hundred dollars more than what a traditional family was paid to stay there, because  
if you're responsible for filling up the home and managing the home and now they bring it to  
the table is a property that there's not a good deal.  
OK, OK. So I think I'm just the client, the guy for tomorrow that I'm meeting. Like I said, and and  
actually is my business partner that got us pretty much into this situation.  
And I told her, I think that she went in there running her mouth and she didn't know what she  
was exactly talking about. But he because I was under the impression that he was going to let  
us use his house to run my business out of. But that's not what he wanted.  
He wanted he wanted her to help him to fill his house so that he can run his own business. But  
he wants me to manage it for him. Yeah.  
He looking for some employees. OK, now I'm not going to do that. Yeah, I'm not going to do  
that.  
Yeah, because if you can fill a house and run it, you can get your own house and keep it. Exactly.  
And that's what I was telling my my business partner.  
I said, number one, you don't ever offer something like that to someone and you haven't even  
gotten your house off the ground. I said, it's very stupid to me. And she didn't understand  
where I was coming from at first.  
But I told her, I say, think about it. If he if you had the blueprint already, you're going to make  
sure you're straight before you make sure someone else is straight. You know, I say because  
he's not going to come and make sure you're straight before he makes sure, you know, before  
himself.  
I say, so you have to think about things like that. But what did you find your partner? OK, that's  
that's a different topic for this. It sounds like you probably want to dissolve the partnership  
before you get in, you know, invested in this.  
Because if you don't have you're not on the same page, you don't have an operating  
agreement. You know, you're both lacking understanding in certain areas. It is going to be a  
disaster waiting to happen.  
And so it sounds like, you know, it may not be something you should be moving forward with  
without the proper understanding of, you know, roles and responsibilities that comes with apartnership. So I I'm not going to be a partner with her when it comes to the group home,  
because like I told her, you know, this was my vision. This was never her vision.  
So, you know, in this business, not personal, but I'm not going to be her partner with this.  
However, she will possibly be my partner when it comes to the behavior health clinic that I'm  
thinking about opening up. And she has been the one bringing the resources to me.  
I'm just trying to figure out how to make her fit into all of that. When that gets off the ground,  
I'm just trying to figure out how to make her how to fit her into it. So that part I'm still working  
on.  
But as far as the group home, I know that she's not going to be my partner with that because I  
told her she procrastinates a lot. And I know for a fact that that's not going to work because  
she's been looking for properties for a month now and has yet to find one property. Whereas  
I've sent out emails just last night and I've had at least five people to reach back out to me that  
has properties on the market.  
And not only that, I also asked them if they're not interested, would they pass my number  
along? So I have meetings this week to go view properties because that's the last step in me  
getting my group home off the ground. So I told her she procrastinates a lot and she does a lot  
of busy work and I'm just not here to do busy work. I'm here to, you know, make a difference  
and make a profit at the same time because I know my situation.  
And I told her until she understands her situation, she's never going to see the big picture.  
Yeah, well, you see the issues that's going on now. So whether it's a group home or a mental  
health clinic, y'all need to go to back to the drawing board to get on the same page because any  
type of lousy behaviors, you know, if she ain't got no drive and she procrastinated, those traits  
are going to go into any business.  
So it don't sound like she's going to be your ideal partner in anything. OK. All right.  
All right. Well, I'll get that. Yeah, she's just a resource.  
She's asking me right now. Save yourself the headache because those characteristics don't just,  
you know, move because you switch the business. You know, being trees.  
This is who she is. Yes, ma'am. Thank you.  
You're welcome. Hey, Miss Lisa Todd. Hello.  
How are you? Good. This is my first call. And.  
I was just I guess my question is. I only saw that you offered the video, the two hour video, and  
in that. I was trying.  
My question is, is that going to be the full scope of your business model that that video that youhave on your Web site? Yeah. So the webinar that that I'm hosting is just a deep dive on reentry.  
Reentry, people who are returning home from prison is not going to teach you how to open  
and start a group home from A to Z is to get you familiar with that particular population, the  
things that they need, how to get them, how to house them, things that you need to have in  
place and so forth and so on.  
So it's it's just for reentry. Reentry is just a population there. Like I made a real and it blew up.  
But inside a group of newbies, we talk about over 25 other different demographics that need  
safe, clean and affordable housing options. So that's just one of many. And so to be able to get  
the full blueprint on everything that you need as far as the business is concerned, then you  
should attend the one of the remaining stops for the two day conference.  
OK. OK. And my last question, I know McKill, he had mentioned, well, if you don't have a house  
right now, then you can be like a placement consultant.  
Is that so that won't be in that webinar what he was speaking of? No, this the only thing in a  
webinar is reentry. OK. OK.  
All right. And honestly, I know that population. I got what grabbed my attention is because I  
was a reentry work with folks that were reentry here in Columbus, Ohio.  
Just basic case management. So I understand that population needs it. So I just wanted to know  
what exactly was I purchasing? What program I was purchasing from you to learn how to do it.  
What you're doing here locally. So, yes. So, like I said, there's just one demographic.  
So for what you're looking for will be at the two day conference. One, how to do it without  
property. Well, only property.  
I guess I wouldn't be able to participate if I didn't have property. It sounds like that's what the  
possibility. No, you can rent these houses.  
OK. OK. All right.  
Well, and that's covered in the webinar. The only thing that's covered in the webinar is reentry.  
How to start a full business and all of that is at the conference.  
The reentry is only talking about housing returning citizens. OK. Yes.  
So it's just I didn't see the webinar that you're speaking. I only saw the returning, which I would  
want to do both. I would want to learn returning visit, you know, returning citizens as well as  
the other side of the business as well.  
Yes. So the webinar is ninety seven dollars and it'll be about housing people who are returning  
home from prison. Like to get them how, you know, how to get the leaves, how to get them inthe house, what they need, so forth and so on.  
The full business operation is fifteen ninety seven. And this is a conference. So the remaining  
steps we have left is Dallas, Texas, which is next Friday and Saturday.  
Chicago, Illinois, Meridian, Mississippi and Charlotte, North Carolina. Those are the remaining  
two day conferences that we go over all of the end being outside of the two day conference. It  
will be either the course that I offer or mentorship.  
OK. All right. All right.  
Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, Mr. Cedric Macon.  
Hello. Hey, how are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm doing well.  
Yeah, I'm actually in Charlotte. We've we've had group homes before. So I want to kind of  
understand the difference.  
And a couple of questions I do have, but I won't hold you long. One, of course, you want to  
know income. What type of income can we get from this? Are these homes sort of just average  
size homes? They're single family homes.  
What I do know in North Carolina, the most people you can have in an unlicensed home is six  
people. So you wouldn't be wanting to go out and try to find a big property. You essentially  
want to try to go find a three bed room house that is at least thirteen hundred square feet and  
put beds in each room.  
Or if you want single room occupancy, you would find a house that can accommodate six  
people in six bedrooms. Or, you know, you can do a little bit of both. Some rooms be private  
and some be private.  
As far as the income, it depends on the people you have. So you have people who are on SSI.  
The most that they're going to be able to afford to pay comfortably is anywhere between 750 to  
800 dollars for a share room.  
You have people who are on Social Security. The most that they'll probably be able to pay  
comfortably is maybe anywhere between 13 to sixteen hundred dollars a month. It just  
depends on if people selling out their assets to be able to have the housing.  
People who are, let's just say, a veteran who has a hundred percent disability rate is around  
four thousand dollars a month. So they it just depends on the person. I got the targets in order  
to decide how much money you make.  
But let's just say the worst case scenario is what I like to try to offer people. And that's doing  
your numbers based on the SSI recipient. Oh, I'm sorry.Doing it based on what again? SSI recipient. Oh, OK. I got you.  
I understand. OK. I had another one.  
Try to remember what it was. What was it? Oh, so how involved do you do you do you staff  
these houses? How involved do you have to be in, I guess, in the lives of these people that will  
be in your homes? Yes. So that also depends on the demographic.  
So for me, my home, I only target people who are independent or semi-independent. And those  
who are semi-independent, if they need some assistance with their activities of daily living, I will  
contract a partner with a non-medical home care agency to send in the caregivers to  
accommodate them with completing those tasks. With my with how I run my homes is I don't  
want to be hands on at all.  
So and in order to not be hands on, you want to deal with people who, you know, don't have  
any behavior issues, not medically ill to where they having to, you know, go in at the hospital.  
People who can do it themselves. Yeah.  
Yeah. So the more independent they are, the better off you will be making sure that you not  
enabling them when they come in and spoiling them. Because if you are too crazy, are you too  
helpful? Then they go be conditioned to, you know, walk those things.  
Whereas if you make them use their life skills and be as independent as possible, then they  
know what to expect. OK, do you have and I know this, like you said, is probably going to  
depend on the population. But do you have any program programming that you that you do  
naturally at your homes? Or is that something more that they will have to seek out for  
themselves? You know, we got the adult they have that they can go to.  
You can have your house leaders host like game nights. You know, they can you can put you  
can put into the like a community board with different resources in the area, like the zoo. So  
whatever resources are in the area, get them the bus route to get there.  
Knowing senior day is senior night is, you know, just have this stuff posted in the house for  
them to be able to do with their leisure. Got it. Got it.  
So and I just want to ask this last question. So are you because I am a I'm an investor myself. So  
are you looking at this? What are you looking at this as an investment, as as a real estate  
investment? Or are you looking at this as just trying to help me? What's what's the like  
overarching? What do you call this? I know it's a group home, but yeah.  
Ideally, I mean, when I first started, it was a desire to help people. But as I've grown in my  
business, I understand that the wealth is on the side of the real estate and we're using this  
model to cash flow it. Got it.  
OK, I understand. That's what I need to know. OK, thank you.You're welcome. Hey, Miss. Everything Marie.  
Hello, good afternoon. My question is, would it make more sense to purchase the home first?  
I'm sorry. Lease the home first and then decorated everything and then look for the clients.  
Or should I get the clients first and then get the home? I was trying to figure out like what  
makes better sense. Yeah. So the first thing you should do is the market analysis to see what  
the needs is in your area.  
See who your referral partners will be. See if you got what it takes to actually market your  
business before going out to get a house. And then now you have overhead expenses every  
single month without filling the bids because marketing is going to be, you know, the heartbeat  
to the business.  
Getting the advertisement out there, building relationships, which, you know, sometimes can  
take time. So you want to kind of already have your phone ringing before going out and  
investing in a property, whether you purchase it or you rent it. But if you have like once you do  
your market analysis and if you see that, you know, the need is, you know, in your area to  
where they going to be bringing your phone off the hook.  
Then the process of actually trying to have to build relationships, you know, you can curve that  
part of the business. But if you're not going to market, if you can't commit to yourself, you  
know, at least four times a week to push out a hundred calls to send out emails to go out in  
person. If you can't do that, you're not going to be successful.  
So I don't ever tell somebody to go, oh, we're going to get a house, we're going to get a house,  
because if you ain't got what it takes to fill the house, then you just putting yourself in debt. Got  
you. Understand.  
So definitely get the clientele know exactly who's going to be in the house before I actually get  
the property in the area as well, because I understand that it has to be in a specific area. It  
makes sense to do those properties in a specific area that has everything that they would need.  
So, OK, understand.  
Thank you. That was my only question. No problem.  
Hey, Miss Graves. Hello. How are you doing? Good.  
I actually just came across your Instagram like a week ago, so I'm just soaking all of this in.  
Thank you for sharing and having this Q\&A. Yes, ma'am.  
So since I'm new to this, I'm just trying to figure out exactly what my forte would be. And one of  
your partners, he mentioned the placement agency. I feel like that would suit me better right  
now until I do, you know, dive and do more research.  
So my first question would be when you first got your leads, like how did you go about gettingthose leads? So the leads that I got, I started marketing to prisons and different hospitals and  
nonprofit organizations in my area. They serve people who are homeless. OK, so what was it  
like a certain title that you asked for when you reached out to them? Social workers, discharge  
planners, case workers, case managers, those titles.  
OK, thank you so much. You're welcome. Hey, Lee Johnson.  
Hello. Can you hear me? Yes, ma'am. All right.  
Just real quick. And I apologize if I've been on and off. I just wanted to make didn't want to ask  
the same question.  
You may have asked already. Someone may have asked, but is it a requirement in having a  
when having an unlicensed group home for reentry citizens? Is it a requirement to be  
registered with the county that you're in that you have this group home that is unlicensed? You  
know, that will be taken reentry citizens. Is there like a registration for the.  
Yeah, it just depends on where you live. Yeah. Some or some some counties or cities have local  
ordinances.  
Just say, for instance, in the state of Texas, we have what is called alternative housing permit  
that we have to have in order to house them. So you can see what type of any type of  
permitting that you need in order to get started. OK.  
All right. I'm here in Michigan and I know I came to your to your when you were here in Detroit,  
not this year, but last year. So and I went out there to the to the group home and everything,  
but I didn't look into that.  
I wasn't at that time interested in the reentry demographic. But definitely now my  
understanding, Detroit don't have no permit. OK.  
OK. I didn't think so. I didn't I didn't think so.  
But yeah, that's what I yeah, that's what I wanted to know. OK. Thanks.  
Hey, Miss Loriana. Hello. Question.  
What are some wraparound services that you would offer? But for your specific if someone was  
doing your specific demographic, like I get the youth, but your specific demographic. What are  
some of the wraparound services? They have pharmacy. Anything that they need when they  
come in the house, not emergency transportation.  
OK. OK, thank you. Hey, Miss Roberta.  
I had to ask a question. When you have first had your first resident, how did staffing look like?  
Did you I mean, because you before, you know, who will be your home, your house manager?Did you put you over there like a lot or. Yes, but I was inexperienced.  
When I first started, I didn't even know what a house manager or house leader was. I just so  
happen to get someone in the house that started, you know, taking over some of the things  
that I was doing. And I was appointed him as my house manager.  
But now, as I start opening up new homes, I get people who are independent or semi-  
independent. They don't need somebody there with them. When I first got started, like I was  
saying, I made a lot of mistakes.  
I was taking in people who had a lot of physical limitations. I didn't know what home care was  
at the time. I took in people who had severe mental health challenges.  
So I didn't know how to properly get people before bringing them into the home. Now I bring  
into people, bring people in the home that whether I have a house manager or not, you know,  
they are survived without me. OK, thanks.  
You're welcome. Ms. Jessica Kennan. Yes, ma'am.  
My question was, I think the prior woman was explaining that she has somebody that wanted  
her to get the house and they want her to fill the house up. And they she was going to like  
pretty much using them for the real estate. And we're me and my business partner in a  
situation where it's the opposite.  
So the guy just want us to get the house. They already have the set up as far as like, you know,  
like they run a whole program. They do you know, they work on a sober living side.  
So they do like recovery as far as that kind of stuff. So they already have referrals. They already  
have all of that.  
So my question to you was like, how will we price that? Because we know what they're kind of  
charging the people to come live there and all the money that they're getting from like, you  
know, the state or whatever. Or do we just do straight market analysis? Like if we go get a  
house in the three eighteen hundred, do we just say eighteen hundred? Do we jump up to like  
twenty five or something like that? How would you handle that kind of situation? Well, for me, I  
would never rent someone's house discount in my pockets. I will want to rent someone's house  
who's looking to allow me to rent it.  
And so I would seek a fair market price. So if the rent is if the market rent is, like I was saying  
earlier, twenty two hundred, the most I'm a pay is twenty five hundred. I'm not going if the  
market rate is twenty two hundred.  
I'm not going to pay an additional thousand dollars for, you know, a property because if they  
rate, I can just go and buy my own property. You know, like I can go find a landlord with a large  
portfolio who's tired of into traditional families. There's not doing right.And I offer them more money to stay out of my business versus, you know, somebody charging  
me an arm and a leg because I'm using a house. OK, I got you. And then I mean, I was.  
Huh? I'm sorry. Go ahead. My bad.  
Yes. I would, you know, just see what you're going radius for the market rate. The market rate  
should be more than what your mortgage is.  
And then, you know, anywhere between I would say fairly anywhere between three to five  
hundred dollars more than what the market rate is. OK, all right. I got you.  
I got you. And then you kind of went fast on that last one. You was explaining the young lady  
had asked you where like you get your lease.  
I heard you say prison, mental health hospitals. What was that third one? I know you said social  
workers and discharge workers. What was you had said? One more after like mental health  
hospitals, though.  
And I missed it. Nonprofit organization. Yeah.  
Nonprofit. OK. And then is it OK if I visit my cousin, my business partner here? Can he join? Join  
my question only because I don't know if I explained it correctly.  
Is it OK if you jump in and just ask you the question that we're trying to get out to you? That's  
fine. OK, go ahead. OK, this is a question.  
So we wouldn't necessarily be. One to run the group home from a landlord like we're not  
renting the property. We own the property outright, but the sober living facility or the  
treatment center would like to partner up with us because we own the houses.  
So how will we charge them to operate in our real estate? So who will be paying the rent? Who  
will the people be paying rent to you or them? So they're going to pay. They're going to pay the  
rent and everything to them. But then they're going to straighten me out by paying basically  
my mortgage.  
And then that's what that's the number we're trying to negotiate now after the mortgage is  
paid. Where are we going to be left? So that's why I'm kind of in a gray area of like what to  
charge them to operate in my house. Even though we we're trying to still operate also, but like  
with other people, they just happen to give us a good deal because they have the caseworkers.  
They have the manager. They have the referrals. They just do not have the real estate.  
Yeah, running it. It's kind of if it's a. Yeah, it's probably a missing piece somewhere, because if  
it's like a hospital or a clinic, they got people that can be housed. They have the money to be  
able to purchase real estate.So it sounds like something is missing with it, because if I'm if I'm if I'm an organization where  
I'm billing insurance, I can afford to go buy my own house. So it's something that you you're  
not catching either. They want you to house them and manage them in the home.  
So you you're going to be charging for your rent. I mean, you know, charging them for the  
dwelling, but also charging them your management fee. Like it's something you you missed.  
OK, well, I'm running back with them and figure it out, because I'm just trying to figure out how  
would that work being because it's like they have two houses. They have two properties right  
now. They're running two apartments and doing this situation.  
So I'm going to be the person that will bring in the the detach of, you know, single family  
homes or whatnot. So I'm just trying to because they have what we need, which is the referrals,  
the connections and everything. But we also they also need the housing also.  
Right. But if they're going to be if you're going to be going to them for referrals, then they are  
not needing your house to rent the house from you. You can have your own house and you can  
get the leads from them and fill up the bids.  
OK. All right. Thank you.  
Yeah. You just need to rehab a conversation because it's a missing piece somewhere. All right.  
I appreciate it again. No problem. All right.  
Yeah. So it's supposed to just been a one hour session. We've been on for almost two hours.  
But those of you who have not got your questions answered. Just tune in to the next Q\&A and  
just be, you know, the first step to raise your hand. Also, you can use the search bar inside a  
group homes for movies, Facebook group to look up keywords.  
There may be questions that was already asked where you can go on down a rabbit hole in the  
search bar and, you know, read different discussions in the group. Tomorrow do begins the  
webinar for the reentry class. If you have not signed up yet tonight is the last day for  
tomorrow's session.  
We like I was saying earlier, we do have our two day conference tour coming to an end. We  
have the remaining four stops in Dallas, Texas, Chicago, Illinois, Meridian, Mississippi and  
Atlanta. I mean, Atlanta, Georgia, Charlotte, North Carolina.  
But we do have the lunch and learn in Atlanta, Georgia. So anybody that's in the state of  
Georgia, I encourage you is limited seating, obviously. But I encourage you to sign up.  
I will post it if you in Georgia. I repost the flyer for that. I, I do plan on having another Q\&A next  
week.So just be on the lookout for that. If y'all are inside the school community on, um, it's a school  
app. There'll be another way for you to be notified for the next Q\&A event.  
Um, and also the two day conferences are not state specific. We encourage you to travel to the  
nearest location. If you in Florida, come to Mississippi.  
Um, if you like Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, you know, come to the Mississippi  
conference. Um, anybody that's around the state of Texas, come to Dallas. Anybody in the area  
where Chicago is or Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio.  
You missed it. Come to Chicago. Um, cause those are the remaining stops that we have for this  
year.  
We do have payment plans available as well. Um, and we may have some meetups here and  
there throughout the remaining of the year. But there will not be any more conferences in  
person conferences this year outside of those four stops.  
I'll post the school link. Give me one second. There's the school link.  
So if anybody has not joined us on school yet. That's the link to join us on school. It's just like  
Facebook, um, our Facebook group without all of the distraction from your timeline, without all  
of the algorithm suppressing the information.  
So if you want to, um, I highly suggest everyone to join us on school. Download the app. It's the  
school app.  
It's S-K-O-O-L. I know for sure I have a free webinar scheduled for July 15th. July 15th, 6.30 p.m.  
You'll see me, um, dropping that link here pretty soon.  
But that is a webinar. It's different from a Q\&A. It's a webinar, um, but it's not going to be a  
charge.  
So that webinar is going to be a PowerPoint presentation. Uh, June, I mean July 15th at 6.30  
p.m. So you can mark that on your calendars to look out for the link for that. But I'll try to do a  
Q\&A.  
Let me look at my calendar right now. So y'all can kind of have an idea of when the next Q\&A  
will be. Oh, well, Makayla will be in town next week.  
So I know we won't do a Q\&A next week. Because we got some projects that we working on  
here. And then, uh, on that Thursday, we'll be headed out to Dallas, Texas.  
Um, for the two-day conference. So there won't be a Q\&A next week. But definitely July 15th at  
6.30 p.m. That will be the next time you all can meet me on Zoom.  
So mark your calendars. July 15th, 6.30 p.m. Central Standard Time. There will be a webinar.Thank you, Ms. Jackson. If you're in the state of Texas, I encourage you to get to the Dallas  
conference. It's next weekend.  
We will be, if you're in the state of Texas, if you want to open up a non-medical home care  
agency, a hospice agency, a home health agency, um, a mental health home, where the state  
will pay anywhere between, um, about $5,000 a month per person with mental health  
challenges. You can house up to 10 in a home. Uh, we'll be going over that contract, showing  
you how to get licensed for home health, hospice, and home care.  
Um, and I mean step-by-step-by-step, not a general overview on how to get licensed. I got the  
PowerPoint presentation for those are in Texas, how to go on the website and get your license  
to be a hospice agency, a skilled, um, home health agency, and a non-medical home care  
agency. So, Texas, I got you.  
If you're here, this is going to be your one and only chance to be able to get all of that  
information, as well as, of course, how to start these unlicensed homes from A to Z, how to go  
through permitting and things like that. In the state of Texas, um, being at One Stop Shop, this  
is the last year that we will have that offer. Um, Ms. Camp, okay, unmute Ms., um, Ms. Camp,  
um, Kiana.  
Kiana, I don't know how I missed you asking the question. I don't do one-on-one consultations  
over the phone. My partner, William, do the one-on-one consultations over the phone, and my  
fiance, DeAndre, does the one-on-one consultations over the phone.  
Um, the most I can do as far as the consultation goes is coming into these Q\&As and answering  
questions. Um, my only offers are, you know, my mentorship program, my course, or the two-  
day conference. Anything outside of that, um, it will be William or DeAndre as far as the phone  
call.  
So, Ms. Kiana, you can unmute so I can answer what you got. Oh, thank God. How you doing,  
girl? Um, yeah, so, I'm in Alabama.  
Um, and I'm doing my research on the permits and the zoning. That's my first step. Um, I own  
my home, and I was trying to move out and downsize for my family to open my home up.  
Our insurance, um, what am I trying to say? They're saying that I have to pay, have a million-  
dollar policy. Is that? Yeah, the million-dollar policy ain't expensive, though. Mm-hmm.  
So, what would I tell my insurance company? Social services. Mm-hmm. Social services.  
Social services. Yep. Insurance company go through NICS and do social services.  
Okay. General liability insurance. Professional.  
Okay. And, um, with me moving out of my house, what would you say, would that be a smart  
business move with me trying to start my new home, or would you rather, would you think thatrenting a property to start the home would be better? No, if you own the home, I would use  
what I can control. Mm-hmm.  
Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay.  
Well, that's what I'm trying to start, and I'm trying to get to your, um, conference in Meridian,  
and I can pay that through CLARNA or afterpay, right? Oh, we have a payment plan through  
Stripe. Everybody gets approved through Stripe. So, if you go on the website, I'll put it on here,  
www.  
Mm-hmm. Oh, and so, also, the LLC thing in Alabama, they claim they don't like to do that, the  
group home thing. So, what would I go under to be able to get my LLC? Uh, you can get an LLC,  
what do you mean? Like, you know, for basically, so they don't want to call them a group home.  
No, I don't recommend anybody calling their business a group home, especially with the term  
group home may be a different meaning in your state. We just use it as an umbrella term for  
this group. Okay, okay.  
But you, yeah, don't put that in your name. Just do something with, like, enterprises, solutions,  
essentials, stuff like that inside your name. Okay, so don't use LLC then? What you mean? For,  
like, my business name, that's what I'm saying.  
So, I was doing the LLC instead of sole proprietor. Oh, no, yeah, do the LLC. Mm-hmm.  
Okay, and that's what I was saying, like, it has to go under a certain category. Right, do  
consulting. Consulting, okay.  
Or just pick up different NAICS codes, or however you pronounce it, to see which one are low-  
risk codes. Low-risk codes, okay. Yeah, whatever industry.  
And that's just more so for, like, when banks get ready to start lending you money, they don't  
want to be lending to no high-risk business. Not to say that it won't be done, but, you know, you  
just want the easier route. Right, right, right, right, right, okay.  
Making sure you pick a code that's low-risk. Okay, I got you. Thank you so much.  
Okay. Okay. All right, y'all.  
All right, y'all. So I'm dropping the link to... Ms. Annette. I'm here.  
Y'all just going to boss hog me, huh? I'm sorry. Go ahead. Can I just... Nah, I'll just inbox you.  
No, go ahead, because... Yeah, go ahead. Okay, so I'm here in Tennessee, and I see a lot of y'all,  
a lot of y'all, you know, from different states or what have you. And I had already contacted the,  
I guess, Tennessee Department of Mental Health, Substance, and all of that, and I had already...  
She sent me the information, and she also sent me the information dealing with, you know, thelaws and the constitutional rights and all of that with Tennessee.  
I read all that in the license, whatever. I just have a question, like, after I have contacted  
everybody, even though I'm coming in with no money at all, like, empty-handed, can I get the,  
like, next step? What do I do next? Is it like a wait period? Because I have already contacted the  
corrections people to ask, you know, do I need training or whatever. So I'm just waiting on  
them to call me back.  
So what's your question? Like, I guess my question is, like, what's the next step? Is it like, do I  
wait for them to call me back or still reach out and contact more people to see, you know,  
what's the next step or whatever? What's the next step for me moving forward? If that makes  
sense. You said you don't have any financial resources. No, ma'am.  
So how do you plan on getting a house? Well, I have, like, a friend that, you know, she's not a  
write grant, so, you know, and I was going to ask her about the grant writing situation to see if  
she can help me out in that area. Go ahead, Will. That's a Will question.  
Yeah. Can I just message you or can we, I message you since we already passed the time we're  
supposed to be on here anyway. Oh, no, you're good.  
She don't mind. I promise you don't. It's every night.  
But I kind of want to speak to, because there's many other people on here who's in your  
situation. Obviously, I was in your situation literally just two and a half years ago. When you're  
trying to go do these things, dealing with the license route, that is a process of several months  
to even up to a year, a lot of capital, you know, a lot of policy procedures, a lot of everything.  
It's going to take time. Grants is cool, and I'm just being honest. Grants is cool, but it's not  
guaranteed.  
You'll be better off trying to create a way for yourself to get that funding, whether it's you start  
an unlicensed group home and facilitate your way. That's what I did. When I hit that barrier, I  
literally started an unlicensed group home solely off the strength to get me back to my youth  
group home, literally.  
Okay. Well, what method is she going to take if she can't get paid for a deposit and first of all  
rent or buy a house? I was going to get to that. Oh, I'm out your way.  
You're good. I'm just going to tell you, I wish two and a half years ago, I knew about people like  
Millionaire Essentials. Now, I don't know what your credit is.  
Somebody else asked, you have to have personal credit, you don't have business credit or  
whatever, what can you do? You don't necessarily have to get business funded solely off of your  
business credit. Of course, ideally, that's what we want to get to at some point. But as new  
business owners, small business owners, we lack a lot of information and knowledge.We're not going to have that right away. But this is where it started. I'm glad Millionaire  
Essentials found NET and this group to start educating us in these conferences and stuff.  
So if you have good credit, you can get with Millionaire Essentials, which is Brandon or Tevin,  
and they will get you approved for funding by personal guarantee. Personal guarantee is just  
saying that, hey, you will co-sign for your business to get funding. And of course, if you don't, if  
your business don't pay it back, then you'll be personally reliable, which is, some people are  
going to say, oh, I wouldn't do that.  
Let me tell you something. If you really want this that bad, you're going to do whatever it takes.  
Right.  
And if you won't do it, that means you're not financially responsible or financially literate. So I  
would watch who I would tell that to. But if you really want this, you're going to do whatever it  
takes.  
And let's say you don't have good credit, because a lot of people don't have good credit.  
Obviously, I had good credit going into it, so it made my life easier, because that's kind of one  
of the things I always worked on in my early 20s, because my family, my mama messed up her  
credit, my granny credit, and everybody else's. They can do that for you.  
They're a one-stop shop. They have team members that will work on your credit. And some of  
our cousins in our proximity right now, they're getting their credit taken care of, so they can get  
them approved.  
Of course, I don't know. I can't tell you what the actual price is, but it's worth it, because we  
know that credit is what's going to help us leverage the money that we get. So how long you  
been wanting to do a group on? Let me ask you this real quick.  
I've been, like, I've been really, really wanting to do it. After I seen the group on Facebook with  
Ms. Annette, and just reaching, at first, I was just looking, looking. And then when somebody  
posts a question on there, it's like the question that I have, but it's like I was scared to ask.  
I was just waiting on somebody else to ask. And when even the questions that Ms. Annette,  
when she get on here and just give out the resources, some of my questions have been  
answered just by her just talking and speaking in general. But I just wanted to, like, get an ump.  
Because, like, some of the stuff that y'all have been discussing, I don't fall in that category. And  
it's just like, oh, man, I ain't going to be able to do that. And I ain't.  
No, but listening to you and listening to others is, like, kind of helpful. But like I said, it's me  
doing it on my own. But when I just, like, give my details, like, y'all, I want to do this, that, and  
the third.  
I done got my name and everything. I have done, like, some Internet research. But I justwanted to, I guess, I need, I'm the type of person, I guess I just have to have it step by step.  
I don't know if that makes sense. I'm sorry. So if you do anything licensed on the state, we'll  
give you a direction.  
But here's your number one issue right now. Your number one issue is funding. That's part of  
your number two.  
Your number one issue is not enough information. Yeah, that's the number one. But like I said,  
just stay curious.  
And if you're working, save. Put money to the side. Get with somebody like Millionaire  
Essentials.  
Let them educate you on how you can get business funding. Tune into every Zoom. If you can  
get to a conference, especially specifically with Dallas, I don't know if they come to North  
Carolina or not, but you need to get to wherever they are or anybody or any resource or  
networking event.  
Well, you don't know if we come to North Carolina or not. No, not us. I meant Brandon and  
them.  
Oh, yeah, they'll be there. Okay, if you can get to North Carolina, Brandon and them do real  
good to break down that stuff in detail, literally. Now the Essentials, is that online too as well?  
Yeah, somebody just dropped the link or I dropped the link when I finished.  
You can get a consult with them and they'll make you go through a questionnaire and  
everything to see what your situation is, talk to you about it and see what your options is. But  
you need to also get out in your community and network with people. There's somebody  
probably at these networking events that's doing exactly what you want to do.  
You just got to talk to them. Of course, they probably won't give it to you for free. I'm going to  
just be honest.  
A lot of people just not like NET and everybody in this group. But you need to find a way how  
you can pay for that information after you vet them out. Also, get in real estate groups.  
That's where all the money is at, from the home itself, from the capital raising, funding,  
everything you can name there is. You got to get out in your community and rub shoulders.  
Like I said, I wish I kind of was open to that stuff two and a half years ago.  
I would have probably met more people. But that's why NET created this group. This group is  
really not just only group homes.  
It's an all-in-one-stop shop. It's also trying to build it to become a little bit, not a little bit better,  
better and stronger so it can be more resourceful for people of all situations. Like I said, I'vebeen there.  
Many people on here who hadn't said nothing in that same situation where you're at, where  
I've been, where NET's been, where everybody's been. So you're number one. If you got an LLC  
already, I would just say, hey, keep researching what you need to research and get with  
Millionaire Essentials so they can try to get you right with the business funding.  
Because if you ain't got no money, your vision not going to be clear. That's how it is. It tore me  
apart.  
I'm telling you, I grieved for several months after hitting that financial wall barrier. I was hurt.  
So if you can minimize that early on and listen to what I'm saying, I'm telling you, do it now.  
Because we got the resources here. It's no excuse. There's just many people here right now  
who asking the same thing about business funding.  
We didn't talk with them several weeks and months ago and they still haven't reached out to  
Millionaire Essentials. They're wondering why the things are not happening for them. So please  
take what I'm saying, reach out to them to the boss.  
And I just talked to Brandon this morning about this. So he's ready. Are you ready? All right.  
Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you, Ms. May.  
You're welcome. Will, are you taking any more questions? Yeah, because my family ain't doing  
that. Yeah, I'll take a few.  
Well, yeah, I'm going to get Will to flow. I have a question. Yes, ma'am.  
Hello. Yes, thank you so much. So I'm coming next week to the Dallas conference.  
And I just want to let you know, I just want to make sure that we will have a sort of paperwork  
to specify what a house manager should be doing. I think I'm having a conflict. I try to help a  
lady out, you know, to be a house manager, but I didn't really have specific roles.  
So I feel like she was overstepping our boundary. You know, she brought cats to the house and  
she opened the window so the cats can be going back and forth to the room, you know. And  
then I realized it's partly my fault because I told her to do like medication reminders and to  
make sure that she does round.  
Everybody comes home, you know. So I just want to ask, are we going to have some, you know,  
like documents, paperwork for them to know their roles? That would be my question. So as far  
as documents, we don't have necessarily documents saying that, hey, this is the role of the  
house manager or leader.  
But we'll be talking about that deeply. And of course, we'll answer questions pertaining to thatwhen we get on that topic. But she goes over the unlicensed group on route.  
Matter of fact, it ain't even just unlicensed group on stuff at times. The group home model in  
general from A to Z, but you don't really need nobody to tell you exactly what your house  
manager should be doing for your, your model. Cause your model is going to be different from  
mine.  
Just like my model is slightly different from Ned in a sense. Although I, you know, I, I followed  
her, her footsteps, but my house manager may not do what your house manager is supposed  
to do because you might be doing a little bit more, provide more services. So that's something  
for you to get on your own and silence.  
Think about all the negatives that has happened pertaining to what happened in your home.  
Something with this house manager. And now that's where you create that, that policy, that  
procedure, their rules, whatever you want to name it based off of that.  
And what you would like to see happen better in your group home. So, but we will talk about it  
for sure. So you will get a little bit more of an insight, but as far as documentation, you won't  
have documentation solely about a house leader.  
Okay. Okay. Thank you.  
Can I ask one more? Do you mix men and women together? How do you do that? Repeat your  
question. Hey, repeat your question. Oh, thank you.  
I'm trying to mute on time. I was wondering how you put men and women, you know, I've  
been, I've had like two, three women in a house. I still have sport.  
I have about four beds left, but I'm just not comfortable. They have called me for meals and I've  
had to like send them to another party. So I just want to have a clarity about how to go about  
housing men and women in the same house.  
Yeah. So first and foremost, I'll say that my homes are poet and I do mix them. Of course you  
want to just kind of pay attention to who you're bringing in.  
So we're just going to say, for instance, like somebody who is a sexual assault offender,  
especially if it's something on the opposite sex of other than what they are, you probably want  
to be a little careful with housing them people, but you just got to really sit there and think  
about what, why would you want to do it? It kind of goes back to your, why you want to do it  
and your end goal with it just housing them without no, no motive can cause you to have some  
issues. Me, I already know my why my why is that because I've been in the medical field all  
around from dealing with seniors and everything in my early twenties. My why is that I  
understand that when it comes to seniors, as we age, as they age, they become depressed and  
that depression can send them to, you know, commit, you know, suicide, unfortunately in ways  
that we don't really think about like overmedicating and some other things.And just simply off of like, let's say there's a grandma in the home that we have in the home, a  
senior, a senior female, and maybe she lost her spouse and she's been grieving. She just can't  
get over it. But maybe she has a male in a home that reminds her of that, of her husband that  
she used to have on this earth.  
And maybe that might be the one thing that is helping her, you know, continue on with life the  
best way she can. So that's my why and that's why I pushed for co-ed at times, but I don't, I  
mean, I don't recommend it just for anybody to do it. You just got to know why you do it.  
So just, just be careful who you, who you mix. Oh, wait, no, we almost through ma'am. Ms.  
Thomas, mute yourself.  
Ms. Thomas, mute yourself. You said Chaco and what else ma'am? Oh, well you the host, you  
can mute her. Oh.  
Sorry y'all. Here we go. So yeah.  
So just make sure you vet everybody out and ask questions. Make sure people are okay with  
being in the home with the opposite sex. Now don't go in there.  
I wouldn't, I wouldn't recommend doing a senior and then you're having a 19 year old in there.  
I just, I just wouldn't do it out. That's a, that age range is too much of a huge spread.  
But like I said, just do your due diligence, do your assessment, vet people ask the proper  
questions. Like I said, one of the questions is probably going to be revolving around some type  
of sexual assault or domestic violence, you know, towards somebody, especially the opposite  
sex. Thank you.  
Where's mama? Any more questions on this good old firework day? Yeah. August. I think it's the  
last week of August.  
I can't net. Can you, you got that date in front of you? It should be 22nd and 23rd. It's the last  
weekend.  
The last Friday, Saturday inside of August. There you go. Okay.  
I appreciate it. Yes, sir. Any more questions? Look, I know somebody, what is the 91 people on  
here? Somebody haven't said anything and ask no questions.  
Don't be nervous. Don't be like me. I used to be nervous.  
I ain't want to do all that talk and asking questions. Ask. Hello.  
There you go. How you doing? Thank you so much. Hi.  
As far as I know, we've already discussed renting versus buying. And my question is, as far as  
someone starting out, how do you, for renting, how do you approach a landlord to rent theirproperty for an unlicensed group home for re-entering seniors? Is Don on here? I think. If not,  
I'll, I'll speak on it.  
Don has a better way sometimes of pushing his narrative when it comes to rent. Okay. So  
number one, you kind of want to, you want to know the landlord's pain points.  
And we always say like, well, I always say to when you're looking for a landlord to rent from,  
don't look for those traditional type of landlords that are emotionally tied to their property.  
Look for the real estate investor who understands money and just wants to rent their home out  
as an extra strategy for whatever reason there is. That's how I look at it.  
And two, we want to think about the pain points. What's one of the issues with landlords?  
Landlords sometimes they deal with depending on what type of tenant they deal with. They  
have these people who laid on rent, don't pay, always having to deal with evictions.  
So that means they have vacancies in their home. And of course, every time their home is not  
filled with somebody paying rent, that is money that is hurting their pocket. Same thing with us  
in a group home game.  
If we ain't got no, our beds filled that's money that's been taken away from us or that's money  
that we just losing out. So the key things that you want to, you want to talk to the landlord  
about, most definitely don't want to tell them you're doing a group home. I wouldn't use the  
word group home.  
We're going to tell them what we're doing, but not the word group home. It's just, it's ugly to  
people. This has always been that way.  
You probably want to say that you're providing housing for somebody like seniors. You could,  
you could say veterans, you could say nurses, but me personally, I will stick to like seniors.  
Some landlords have a soft spot when it comes to seniors, especially veterans.  
It's like, so, so for instance, I will, my, my second landlord, he dealt with a tenant that was late  
on rent for like several months and he just got tired of it. He's a, he's a, he was new in the  
investment game. So he got tired of it.  
Somebody told him, Hey, you might want to consider renting out to group home operators  
because they'll be able to pay the rent all the time, you know, longterm. So I was able to win  
him over in that way because he wanted a different, a different take on the clientele that can  
come in and pay rent. So you want to look for somebody that would accept you to do house  
veterans, seniors, anything like that, the pitch, your ebook.  
I'm sorry. Look for people. I mean, look for landlords that are real estate investors for one, two.  
You want to let them know that you are renting to seniors, veterans, maybe even nurses.  
Number three, you want to let them know that you will have liability insurance because that'sanother thing that they worry about, the liability part and that you will basically pay them a little  
bit more than the market rent. So let's say, let's say they Pam, they mortgage is like $1,800, but  
they can rent the home out in that neighborhood for let's say $2,000.  
You probably offer a hundred or $200 more than that. But it just really depend on a layout. If  
it's a three bedroom or something like that, I'm probably not offering nothing no more than  
$1,900 for that.  
But maybe a four or five bedroom depending on how many people I can get. Then, you know, I  
can play with the numbers. So a lot of this stuff boiled down to the numbers.  
But like Dawn always say, being comfortable and confident when you're going to talk to these  
landlords can and will get you to be able to get them to convert. And you have to be able to  
articulate exactly what you're doing. And in the words of Dawn, a confused mind will always say  
no.  
And that's real. But I will say you're probably going to get many no's before you get your first  
yes. You just got to stay the course and keep pushing.  
But if you want to be able to have an easier way to get a landlord to rent to you, get into the  
real estate investing groups and go to the events, the networking events. They are all right  
there. Let them know what you're doing.  
More than likely somebody will allow you to use their home. All right. Here, did I ask you a  
question? Yes, sir.  
Thank you. All right. Everyone, we about to wrap it up.  
This is getting too loud outside. And I know it's probably hard. But for everybody who was on  
the fence about getting to the conference, please make sure you get to the conference.  
If you have not registered for the Zoom tomorrow, dealing with reentry, please get on it. And  
anybody who is a newbie with little to no information and is trying to get into the group home,  
the unlicensed group home game, and want a guide from A to Z, basically step by step, I do  
have an e-book for $97 that I am doing for newbies that is trying to get into the unlicensed  
group home with little to no information. If you are not a newbie, you already got your group  
home, that e-book is not for you because you probably already passed a lot of those steps.  
You might just need coaching. But if you're a newbie who's trying to get in, I have an e-book for  
you, and I would drop the link here below. And that would be it for me.  
Can I ask one question? Can I ask one question? Yes, ma'am. Sure. Okay.  
Is this considered a non-profit? What are you referring to? I'm sorry. Like having a group home,  
is it considered like, do you, as far as like taxes or anything's concerned, is it like a non-profit  
organization? No, ma'am. We definitely for profit.Okay. Because, you know, I mean, I don't know. I'm just, I'm learning.  
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry for, you know, like my ignorance about it, but I just really don't know.  
Don't apologize.  
We all been here. You know, I just hear non-profit a lot. So I'm like, okay, well, what is non-  
profit? You know, like what would be considered like a non-profit organization? So in order for  
you to be a non-profit and have your mission towards housing people in a group home, you  
obviously would have to get that established and you do that through your state.  
But here's the thing. A lot of people are doing a group, not a group home, a non-profit group  
home. I would not recommend nobody to do a non-profit, not because it's not a good thing to  
do.  
It's because majority of the people don't have the knowledge behind it. So if you're going to do  
it, I highly advise you, especially because you're asking, which is, it's not an issue. Go consult  
with somebody who has a non-profit that teaches you how to do a non-profit.  
Or even get on the state's website and ask them questions on the phone about a non-profit and  
do your research on it. Because it's not what everybody thinks starting off when you don't have  
the knowledge. After you have the knowledge and you're fully aware of it, of course, it can be  
something great.  
But remember, nobody owns a non-profit and you can't be voted off. You need board  
members. Getting grants is not 100% right away.  
You have to put in work. You have to sometimes be in business or the non-profit world for  
about a year or two just for a corporation or something to want to donate to you. I don't know  
if Pinky is on here.  
No, no, no, sir. No, sir. That's okay.  
I was just wondering just that one question. I'm not looking into going into non-profit. I just  
wanted to know, is this a non-profit organization in some type of way or something? It could be  
either or.  
It depends on how you set up your business. Because a non-profit is still a business. You can  
still make money.  
You just have to put yourself on salary and things like that. So you can do either or, however  
you set it up. But of course, whether you go a non-profit or a for-profit, like I said, it just  
depends on your model and what you're trying to do and your mission.  
Okay. Thank you so much. No problem.  
Did somebody say something? Yeah. Can I get one more quick question? Yeah, you'll be the lastone. You got somebody with a hand up too, bro.  
I wanted to ask, is it my understanding that you are like when you're doing re-entry that you  
want to do like say seniors only that either have a social security income or SSI or disability  
income? Yes, sir. And if you register for the Zoom tomorrow, that's exactly what Ned is going to  
break down to the T. Okay. I'll give you the do's and the don'ts, everything to where you should  
be able to have a clear vision as to why we do the things we do, number one, with re-entry.  
And two, why people don't believe that you can actually do it because they only know one way.  
So if you haven't registered for the Zoom, please get on that Zoom. She's going to give it  
straight to you when it comes to re-entry.  
It's real. There's no fluff. It's just a lot of people don't know the way that we do it.  
Is there a question and answers on that Zoom or? I'm pretty sure it is. She never do a Zoom  
where she don't answer no questions, even if she says she's not going to do it. That's just her  
nature.  
One more quickie, one more quickie. Now, is it all right if you mix and match? Like say, you  
know, you got your re-entry with like a veteran or whatever. Is it OK to mix like re-entry, you  
know, with say like veterans or disabled or whatever like that? So we love this question.  
So remember, people who are re-entering into society, some of them are veterans as well. OK.  
But to overall answer your question, that will boil it down to how you are going about getting  
those re-entry people.  
And they send them to me. Well, when it comes to that, they might tell you, hey, we don't want  
you mixing our people that we're sending you with the people that's out in the community. But  
we get them because we don't have no contract.  
We just literally networking. We do what we want to do. And of course, the state don't care  
because once they release, they release them.  
The most they might say sometimes is that depending on what kind of charge you have and  
you're a felon, they might just say, hey, we don't want you in a home with this other type of  
felon. But because you are, if you are a group home, you're a group home or a sub name,  
wherever you're at, that is never an issue. So it just really depends on how you're acquiring  
them and who is telling you what to do and what not to do.  
But for us, we mix them. I have a matter of fact, I have a person who came home from prison  
that is a veteran. So I have two veterans in my home.  
OK. OK. But I mean, so clearly, I mean, so like I mean, it doesn't matter.  
You can mix and match, like, say, for example, if you have a non parolee veteran versus a  
veteran that's coming out of prison. I mean, it's OK to mix and match those those thoseclassifications. I mean, most most definitely it shouldn't be an issue because remember, they  
don't have no ties.  
Nothing is tied to anybody. They are in a free world now. OK.  
Like I said, parolees, sometimes they may have some type of restriction. And of course, it  
depends on if you're contracted with somebody or not and what your city or county is saying as  
well. But most of the time, it shouldn't be no issue the way that we go about getting these  
people as long as you are able to do the same way.  
But that's what that's going to break down to the teeth. That's that's that's our population. 100  
percent of them in the home, although I know it, but she don't break it down 100 percent for  
sure tomorrow.  
OK, she she sent that link to where? Oh, Ned, if you still don't hear, drop the link. It's  
somewhere in here, but you're probably going to be strolling for days. But, Ned, drop that  
Zoom link for tomorrow.  
All right. OK, got you. Thank you.  
Appreciate it, man. Can you also send the link to the Millionaire Central? Yeah, it's it's it's in  
here. I got to scroll up.  
OK, OK. All right. Thank you.  
You're welcome. Miss Brown had her hand up, too. I don't know if she's still in.  
I'm going to post the Millionaire Central and I'm going to post the returning citizens. So y'all be  
looking for these links. OK, thank you.  
OK, yes, I'm still here. I guess I can pick up tomorrow. Signs up for your class.  
I'm sorry for your Zoom tomorrow. Miss Brown, if you want to, you got me. You're going to be  
the last one.  
Thank you kindly. I'm going to make it quick. I have interest in investing in property first and  
not renting.  
Is it possible that I can network with you guys on that part also? Yes, you can. So actually, my  
partners, who's obviously teaching me the real estate game is Dion. I think McKay got out.  
But Dion Dion has a virtual office where I mean, from the wholesale side, from acquiring the  
properties, all that. He have a system where you can go into the virtual office. He can talk to you  
more about the qualifications to be able to go into there.  
But he is on here. Dion, can you drop a link or let them let her know how she can connect with  
you to get into the virtual office? Yes, sir. Miss Brown, just send me a message, a DM onFacebook and I'll respond to you.  
OK, thank you guys. Yes. No problem.  
Hello. William, can you hear me? Yes, Mr. Benjamin. Yes.  
Hello. Did you say Ms. Benjamin? I guess it was Ms. Jones. My question is for the school app.  
I usually log in through the web browser to get to school and then I get the messages in my  
email. But I download the actual app. But when I go in the actual app, I can't find group home  
for newbies.  
It gave me like a thousand possibilities. And I'm like, I can't go through all a thousand to find  
you guys. Is it something I'm not doing right? No, it gets funky sometimes.  
We're getting it to post it on the Facebook group, the actual link out of the app. That way it  
should take you straight there. It gets tricky sometimes.  
We've been having that issue for a little while. So I'll have her post it in the Facebook group. OK.  
Just be on the lookout. Hey, William. What's going on, Mr. Pitt? I'm your last man.  
Here's what I got. You changed my way of thinking. I've got eight houses in South Georgia that  
some are rented.  
Some are not rented. I think I'm going to shift. I think I'm going to shift more towards the  
people that I was.  
What it is, I've got older homes. They're old wooden homes. They need to be refitted on some.  
Some of these, you know, good portion of work. But you don't have a lot of restrictions in the  
area. I bought those methodically along highways, but in communities, kind of, sort of.  
I don't know whether you're familiar with Georgia at all. But it would be Southeast Georgia.  
Montgomery County, Trootland County, and Jeff Davis County.  
All without neighbors. Some on acreage. But I got two houses, just six, for example.  
Two on two acres. Two on one acre. Not a lot of interaction with people.  
Montgomery County has a prison locally in the Mount Vernon. Mount Vernon's the town of  
Montgomery County. I was, because of the cost of get everything done, I was kind of thinking,  
because I was going to speak with Lynette about that.  
And I sent her a message about a week ago. But I was thinking about going in. And at the age  
I'm at now, which is 65, I'm not really interested in going in and fixing the houses to get the  
tenants to do the, you know, that whole.I was interested in, I was curious about what she does, and I was considering it. But now that  
you spoke about people going out and just finding the landlord. Basically, I mean, if we could  
come into some sort of agreement.  
I'm rethinking it now as we speak. Just find somebody that does what you all do. Look at what  
we got.  
Hey, man, here's a number. Give me some rent. You do what you do.  
I know for a fact in Trutland County, don't have any restrictions on what you do on the  
properties. I've got four in Trutland, which is Soperton, Georgia. And I got four in Mount  
Vernon, which is Montgomery County.  
I mean, I'm putting it out there is what I'm doing right now. I've been kind of waiting and  
listening, listening, listening. When you got on, you kind of, I was going in.  
At first, I was going in with the idea of going in and doing the, you know, offenders type deal,  
what you all do. But now I'm rethinking it. What do you think? I think that's perfectly fine.  
I mean, you've become a resource and an advocate for people out here who need to get into  
these homes. You know, if you have something you want to sell, let us know. Not so much.  
Matter of fact, I was leaning towards sale, but you know, you talked me out of it. I could rent it  
now. Well, if you're ever thinking about differently, let us know.  
Mikel, my partner Mikel is out there and I'm always looking for property out there. Him and  
Dion, that's one of their markets. And of course, I'm probably going to try to go into the Atlanta,  
Georgia market as well.  
I'm in southeast Georgia. It's a little more rural. More close to Douglas.  
But an hour and a half out of Savannah. Two hours out of Savannah. But Dublin, Georgia,  
Vidalia, Georgia, that area.  
Let's connect. Let's see what we can do. Because, I mean, it's many people.  
Georgia and Texas is probably the deepest in our group. So it's a lot of people that is looking for  
homes and stuff. So let's see what we can do for somebody out there who's serious and ready  
to go.  
Yes, sir. And Mr. Pitt, I would also make a post in the group, too, because we only have like 70  
people on here. But if you make a post in the group, you probably going to get some interest.  
I saw Miss Brown said she was interested, too. Right. Okay.  
I mean, I'd have to make a post in this group. You mean on Facebook? Oh, on Facebook. Yeah,  
in the Facebook group, Group Homes for Newbies.Okay. All right. I'll do that.  
Thank you, Mr. Pitt. Thank you. All right, y'all.  
That will conclude the night. I'm tired. I got to get up early in the morning to do some work.  
Everybody have a blessed night. Let all this good information marinate and be ready for  
anybody who's on their Zoom call tomorrow to get all the game and knowledge you need. Have  
a blessed night.  
Good night. Thank you. Good night.  
Thank you. Good night. Good night.  
Good night, everyone. What are y'all eating? What? Oh. Oh.  
Oh. Oh. Oh.  
Oh. Oh. Oh.  
Oh. Oh. Oh.  
Oh. Oh. Oh.  
Oh. Oh. Oh.  
Oh.
