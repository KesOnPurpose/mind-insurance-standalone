The Lynette Story 7:19:2024  
As a group need to start. Start thinking more about ownership. You know, that was a lot of the  
message that was at the conference this weekend.  
Absolutely. So don't get them ready, please get everybody ready. Hey, they don't.  
We I talked about it a little bit last week on the zoom the real estate zone series last week. We  
were talking about, you know, some of the ones from the group that are interested in creating  
a fund of funds. And you'd be able to take that and go and start pulling money together to go  
and put into multifamily deals that depending upon what those multifamily deals look like and  
how they're you know, what the makeup of it is.  
You can turn half of it into, you know, behavioral health, housing, half of it into sober living,  
housing. If they're especially if they're broken up in different sections, you know, I don't know  
what to do with that, man. Right now, what I'm looking into, especially here, we have access.  
Well, I'm just going to be the same in every state. I'm looking into purchasing broad already.  
Somebody mute her, please.  
Already licensed homes. OK. So and it's a lot of them, what happens is a person gets tired of  
owning a licensed group home and they just let the license go.  
But if you catch them like right in that area, right before they let it go and right before the  
license expires and just make them an offer purchase that business with the license, then you  
just renew the license. Exactly. Now, Johnny, so.  
Oh, go ahead, brother. No, I was just going to say that's a good way to get into the business  
and also a lot of those licensed homes might have a contract already. So you guys start thinking  
about that also instead of just buying a home and then starting from scratch, look into  
something that's already ongoing when the where the owner is tired of, you know, running a  
group home and purchase the business from them.  
That's going to include the real estate, the license and possibly a contract. Johnny, I love where  
you're going with that, man, because a couple of months ago we had pulled a list from the state  
of Texas because guys, the license licensed homes are listed within the state that you can go at.  
Like, it's not like you have to skip tracing these people.  
Their contact information is there. So depending upon how you want to market, we'll drop  
some gems real quick while we wait to start, depending upon how you want to market,  
especially if you want to go the license route, but don't want to go through all the hoops and  
ladders that are already there. You need to start marketing to that entire list, sending letters,  
sending text messages, sending emails if you got their email, seeing if they want to sell their  
business.And again, just like the real estate side of it, guys, depending upon what they're doing and how  
they're doing it and what they need, you might be able to get into that deal creatively. Like  
people buy businesses creatively all the time. You it's not just real estate.  
I told you all last week and showed you all some different examples on how you can literally go  
in and buy whatever you want creatively. The entire world is ran off of wholesale and creative  
finance. You just got to you just got to get in what you fit in and make yourself appealing and  
bring value.  
Find out what your person needs and bring value and see how you can structure that deal  
together to make sure that everybody walks away a winner. There I'm telling you, there are a  
ton of people out here just from the list that we pulled that time that do not want to run the  
business anymore, but they don't know how to exit. They're they.  
Hey, Don, somebody asked, why would somebody want to sell if the business is lucrative?  
Because they're tired of running a business. They want to retire. They don't want to do this  
anymore.  
They're done with it. They just want to walk away from it. And they don't know from a business  
like this where the license is under their name, their LLC.  
They don't quite know exactly what an exit strategy looks like outside of just letting the license  
lapse or running away with it. Nobody probably has ever approached him and said, hey, will  
you sell your business to me? I'll buy it and we can transfer the license. So you know that you're  
coming up on a couple of different things.  
You're already going to have a licensed facility. More than likely, it's going to have some type of  
staff in there that you might be able to acquire as well. That's already familiar with how the  
business is ran day to day.  
So you're just coming in and implementing your core values that you want the business  
running after now, your mission statement on how you want the business ran. And if you have  
a couple of people that's running your day to day operations now, you're bringing them in as  
well and implementing them into a well operating system. Now, the best possible thing you can  
come across is actually a business that is not running effectively, because typically that business  
for cheaper and you can walk into a situation where now you can implement your policies,  
procedures and strategies on how to build that business up.  
Now you're going to two and three X the money that you put into this business because you got  
it for cheap. You just know how to make the business run effectively. So that is the real thing to  
look for, something that's distressed, that's not being ran well, that you can come in and take  
the knowledge that you get from this group, from some of the people that are coming into this  
group and bringing, you know, knowledge on the license side of things.  
Use what they tell you and teach you and go and implement it into this business that's alreadylicensed. So we got the big hurdle that a lot of people are scared of out of the way. Now it's just  
going in and being a business person.  
Yeah, that's that's excellent, Don. I mean, like like you said. I think it will be better to find one  
that's not running well.  
Right. Use the use this group. Use what you know to make that business a winner.  
This person is going to sell it to you cheap because like Don said, they're tired, they're not  
making money anymore. They probably made all the money they want to make. It's not  
running well.  
They're not at the business as often as they used to be. Get that business and then implement  
your processes or our processes, because you can get it from us, implement those processes  
and have that business turned around in months. And then now you want to sell.  
Here's the thing is, when you let me let me let me lay this for you guys. Oh, I know what you're  
going. I know where you're going.  
Come on. You start a business to grow it and sell it. Oh, my God.  
OK. Don't don't be attached like that show, baby, because let me tell you a secret. Once you  
know how to start, run, operate and make the business efficient, you know how to do it again.  
Yeah. So once you have that going, you now you have some multipliers that come with the  
business, guys. If you bought it and it's operating at 400,000, you're making less.  
Let's just say you're making half a million a year to take on that. There are business multipliers  
that you can add on there that make sure that make your business worth more than that  
money that you're bringing in. Let's say you put a four X multiplier on there.  
Now, that business that you might have bought for three hundred and fifty thousand. You're  
turning around. You're making half a million dollars a year off of it now, and then you can turn  
around if you have a four X multiplier on it.  
Let me tell you, this number is going to be a little different. Actually, it'll be a little bit higher  
because I'm talking about take home. It's not even going to go off of that.  
It's you can there's probably three or four different business models that you can business  
acquisition models that you can look at to be able to purchase it. But let's say you did buy for  
three fifty. You've been making half a million dollars a year off of it.  
You can turn around and sell it for two and a half million. And then you can go back and redo  
the process all over again. Do not do not do not do not get attached to a business.  
Oh, this is my baby. I started it. I have another one.Right. Right. Exactly.  
Exactly. So the thing with that, Don, is, you know, people do they get attached to the business?  
And well, you know what? They get attached and it turns out they turn into one of those people  
that want to get out of the business, because when you get attached to it, you're you're it kind  
of burns you out. Yeah.  
But if you get in with the intent of increasing the value and then selling it, like Don said, sell it  
and do another. I think it's I think it's really important to to share that a lot of people,  
depending on where they're at in their journey, just like real estate, right? Let's if most people  
are more familiar with real estate, let's look at it from that angle. Some people are fixing  
flippers, which is essentially what you do with real estate.  
You find a distressed property, you fix it up, you add value to it and then you sell it. That's the  
same concept that you're doing with business. But there are also people who want cash flow  
that just wants to hold on to it to sustain their life.  
And I think everyone, depending on where they are, might say, you know what? Right now in  
this season of my life, I want to hold on to cash flow. So buying a business that is cash flowing  
pretty well and working really well right now for this season of life might be where they are. So  
they may look for a thriving business and just buy that.  
And so they already have a good operator in place. And that's a different criteria for buying a  
thriving business than one that's distressed and all are great. Right.  
And ultimately, depending on the mindset and where you are, having an exit is the purpose  
most people have for businesses. So that's all that like. Non-negotiable, you should set your  
business up to have an exit at some point.  
But it depends on the season of life that you're in. And so some people listening to this and be  
like, well, I don't want to do that. I want the cash flow.  
I want to live off and off of that. I want to go take vacation and all that type of stuff. And some  
people love the quick flip.  
Like, let me make that two million on one deal and move on. But it really depends on the  
season of life everyone's in. Well, let me tell you something sweet about that whole strategy,  
especially if you buy an ongoing business, be it thriving or distressed, more than likely, it's in a  
state where it's paying for itself.  
This is for the Shonda Joyner, the Shonda. Find a business that's already ongoing. But I mean,  
it's still in business.  
It's not your money that you're paying. Let's just say you get a mortgage on it or some kind of  
loan to get this property or to get this business. You're not using your own money to pay thatmortgage.  
It's the business paying the mortgage. You might come out of pocket with like a down payment  
or you talk to Don. He'll give you some creative strategies to get into that business.  
But. Your business is paying for itself. So I don't want you guys to think that you got to save up  
a lot of money or you got to have a lot of money to to do this strategy that we're talking about  
right now.  
We're talking about. If and when you get into it, the business is going to pay for itself  
immediately. In most instances, you're not going to you're not going to purchase a property  
that's not generating some income.  
Even if it's only paying half for itself, you already know that you're going to get it to a state  
where it's becoming profitable. But it's not out of your pocket that you're paying for the  
expenses. Your residents are paying your expenses, just like regular real estate.  
We're just doing it by the rule. There you go. There you go.  
There you go. Well, looks like the lady of the hour is sending us a couple of messages, letting us  
know that ginger is ready to go. I'll mute that.  
Let's go. Let's go. All right.  
See you guys later. Good evening, everyone. How is everyone else you're doing? Thank you.  
Good. I did it. Well, we're not going to take a lot of your time.  
We're just the beginning commercial break that's going to come in. I'm ginger. And this is my  
sister, Trish.  
I am. We're actually government contractors. We're just, you know, coming on just to give you a  
little, you know, snippet about what we do, who we are.  
First of all, I want to thank Matt for even having us on here. Just knowing her as a person, just  
interacting with her. It's just amazing to do so, to hear who she is and take a deep dive to find  
out where her foundation is.  
I am excited. I am a ball of emotion. So I know you guys are.  
And, you know, I got my Kleenex box. I got my Kleenex right here because I'm an emotional  
wimp. I'm not sure.  
Well, again, as Ginger stated, we only here to take a small snippet of your time because the  
moment is all about net. So again, we are government government business contracting in a  
sense. So I just want to let you know anyone that's interested in government contracting, you  
know, it's recession.Recession proof is diverse opportunity. It's a steady cash flow. And each and every one of you  
can do it.  
Long term partnership. Guaranteed money, baby. That's coming from the government.  
So just if you're interested, you can check us out on GovBiz Network on Facebook. We'll drop it  
in the chat. Next week, Thursday, we're going to have a live.  
We had a live last week. It was just so wonderful. But, you know, we got a lot of gems that we  
want to share with you guys.  
There's just so much opportunity, so much money. Like, you know, every anybody can do it. You  
know, if you can mow lawn, if you can cut her hair, you know, you can purchase food.  
You know, everybody can do it. But, you know, we're not going to lie to you and say it's a get  
rich scheme because it's not, you know, it's for the strong. You know, it's if you have their  
endurance, you know, some people can work by themselves, they can work with a team.  
But it's doable. You know, we're real life people. This one right here found a husband, moved  
back to Jamaica.  
And is, you know, we're partners. But it has given her the opportunity to work wherever on the  
beach. I'm like, you know, sometimes calling her like, where are you? She's like, you know, I'm  
hearing the waves in the background.  
I'm like, I'm jealous, like I'm coming home. But, you know, it just affords you the opportunity to  
be free. You know, yes, we you know, we have staff.  
We have a staffing company. We have home care. We are diving into the group home.  
And real estate, because, you know, we are we are definitely, you know, advocates of multiple  
streams of income and generational wealth, which is very important. You know, we do it  
because we love it, not because money. You know, we're making difference in lives.  
So like we said, you know, we have a lot. You know, we have a group and we're going to drop  
the information in the chat. If you guys want to reach out, I'm Ginger Sims.  
Don't look for her because she's not a communicator. Find me. And, you know, let's just chat,  
you know, and see, you know, we'll have honest conversations.  
You know, it may not be may not be right now or it might be later, you know, or, you know,  
maybe it just might be like I spoke to a nurse earlier. And, you know, with the contract that we  
have, we're going to partner on that. You know, we're getting into international contracting.  
Well, we're going over to Trinidad, Guyana, Ghana. So there is so much opportunity. But, you  
know, we can talk all in, you know, for the whole night, you know.But because we started, you know, a little late, we're going to come off the radar. We're going  
to turn it back over to Mr. Faithful servant, husband, father, serial entrepreneur, real estate  
investor, property problem solver. Mr. Don, real rich.  
I've never been introduced like that before. I kind of like it. Oh, I didn't look at that guy.  
Well, it's so long. Come on, Nick. Y'all are missed.  
That's so pretty. Girl, you look so okay. Yes, girl.  
Love the dress. Oh, my God, girl. Y'all got a hot tuxedo on.  
Y'all are missed big. She got the natural reaction out of me. Oh, my God.  
Oh, man. Yes, I am. First, ladies, thank you.  
Thank you both. I appreciate all the gems that you ladies dropped for us because that was very  
informative. Again, like I've told you guys, I'm always a student.  
And so the amount of notes that I took from your Zoom was amazing. So I'm looking forward to  
our two on one conversation. Got a little busy last week, but looking forward to us getting back  
in and having that conversation.  
But guys, now to get into why we're all here tonight. And a couple of weeks ago. Ned had put  
out this post about her story, and I could tell it was one of those times where Ned was just  
probably sitting in the bed on the couch or something and just overthinking and looking at  
things and say, you know what? I'm about to post and tell these people where I came from.  
They got to know who I am and what the struggles that I've been through and through those  
struggles where I got to. And I instantly called, I said, Ned, this is a story. This ain't no post like  
this ain't something we just posted and glaze over.  
People have to know the intricacies of your story. Because there's a lot of people on here and  
there's a lot of people not on here that probably should be on here to listen to what we're  
about to uncover tonight. As we, as I stated in the video, peel back the layers of her life, the  
journey that she's been through, the learning curves going up these mountains, trying to get to  
different peaks.  
How she overcame everything. Everything to get to where she is now. And guess what, guys?  
On the trip up Everest, she's probably only at base camp one.  
There are multiple levels that Ned is going. And I'm glad to be partner with her. I'm glad to  
have this opportunity to interview her in deep dive tonight and to make her hot, humble, open  
and transparent with this story.  
As we dig deep. And uncover some of the layers, so sit back, grab some popcorn, grab sometissue, grab some wine, if you would drink. And let's uncover everything.  
Lynette Rushing, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much, Dan. So beautiful.  
Thank you. So, Ned, you told me quite a bit. And you text me a couple of things that you wanted  
to highlight on.  
But I'm a you know me. I'm going off script. I'm going to get I'm going to hit the stuff that you  
want to hit.  
But I'm also probably hit on some of the stuff that you don't want to pull out. But we got to pull  
it out in order for you to get to the next levels of where you're going. So I'm going to let you  
start and tell us, Ned, when you were.  
Well, first off, where were you born? I was born in 1992 in Meridian, Mississippi. 1992 Meridian  
in the SIPP as it's so eloquently called. So, Ned, give me a little give me the first three years of  
your life.  
You start telling the story and I'll cut you off where I want. OK, so so. When I reached year  
three, that's when my mother passed away.  
Prior to my mom passing away, I was able to get a little bit of mother daughter bonding with  
my mom. And of course, as a toddler, you don't really know what to expect and what not to  
expect from your parents. All I knew was at the time.  
My dad would go to work, my mom stayed at home. While my mom was at home, she was  
always sleeping. When she woke up, she woke up to feed us and go back to sleep.  
And during that time. I was able to witness a few things that resonated me throughout the  
years, and a lot of it was OK, but like this now that I'm older, I can look back and see what it  
was. But at the time, as a child, I would just only be able to see a mom who's always sleeping  
and a mom who was.  
Abusive, so to speak, so I have is four of us, I have a twin sister and I have two brothers and my  
oldest brother caught the blood of my mom's mental health issues. My mom was diagnosed  
with schizophrenia. And she was someone who was.  
She loved her children, but I also witnessed her. Dark side. And on her dark side, it consisted of  
my oldest brother being.  
Physically abused. With the iron pipe that was in the closet, so he would always get abused. She  
would be sleeping.  
My dad was a working man. I have a scar on my arm. I'm not able to show it, but I was I was  
burned.Why my dad was there were. And when I became older, I would say, let me be like in my  
teenage years. I always thought that the scar on my arm was from the lab, but it looks like a  
cockroach on my arm.  
And I always said somebody burned me. Somebody burned a cockroach on my arm. That was  
what my mind was, you know, when I was a child.  
And so as I got older, I asked my dad, what happened to my arm? And he said that, you know,  
that was just like a mystery because my mom had mental health issues. So he didn't know that  
if it was something that she did to me or I ran into something, but I have a bad scar on this  
arm. And so it was just the product of, you know, being left with somebody with mental health  
issues and a schizophrenic.  
And so, um. Ned, I want to I want to stop you there for a second to ask you a question here. OK.  
What you have just described for all of us is traumatic enough. For, you know, anybody to be  
able to. Have the death of your mother at three years old.  
You don't really understand exactly what all is going on. At that time, you know, this is when  
your your your subconscious is really just starting to come in, too. And things are really just  
beginning to make sense a little bit in those toddler years and then tragedy begets you.  
What is the relationship like right now with your other siblings? And how did the trauma that  
you guys went through? Affect or have an effect on the relationship that you all have today and  
how you all communicate with one another? Well, so for me and. Let's just say my dad had  
three kids by my mom and then my oldest brother had his own dad. So with me and my twin  
sister, am I next to oldest brother? I don't think that.  
We've. Experienced the trauma that my oldest brother experienced, because at the time he was  
12 years old. So what a 12 year old man he saw, he was able to witness all of the bizarre  
behaviors that my mom had.  
He was the one that got physically and verbally abused. To my knowledge, me, my sister and  
my other brother next to the oldest. We didn't get physically and verbally abused by my mom.  
But my oldest brother did. And so I can kind of say that part of the. How do I work this? My  
brother, my oldest brother may have experienced a lot of that abuse because my brother was  
diagnosed with mental retardation.  
And so that is called IDD now. And so with the IDD with someone who has severe mental  
illness, it's like a balance in the house that was off. Right.  
So he did things that she probably viewed as how people say you retarded. She viewed it as him  
being retarded. And she responded in a way of somebody who's being retarded or acting  
retarded.And so he had to deal with all of it. And so with my oldest brother, him going back to our  
hometown, hometown is not something that he likes to do when it when I would try to talk to  
him and ask him things about my mom. Being that he was older.  
That's the conversation that he don't want to hear. So he was the one that actually lived. With  
my mom throughout the three years that I was alive.  
My mom and my dad had a split. I'm not sure how far in my life that they split up. But I do know  
towards the end of her life, she had her own apartment.  
But I do remember times that my mom lived at my dad's house. So my my sister and my  
youngest oldest brother, we're fine. But my oldest brother, you know, he's traumatized.  
And he's not the one to be able to speak highly of my mother. And that's due to, you know, his  
traumatic experiences, the things that he had to endure. And being that he have, you know, the  
intellectual disability, he's not able to understand or grasp the concept that your mom had a  
mental illness.  
And, you know, that's the reason why he. Got the blood in of, you know, why my why my mom  
was alive. Got it.  
Got it. So three years old, your mother passes away. What is the initial change in life that  
happens for you right after? Well, when my mom first died.  
Let's back up a little bit. OK. Me, my sister and my two brothers are the ones that was in the  
house with my mom while her body was there, lifeless.  
It was my sister who prompted the next door neighbor. My mom lived in a duplex. At this time,  
she had already moved out of my dad's house.  
My dad had a house and my mom had a duplex apartment that she was renting. And so her  
neighbor, which so happens to be a relative of my dad's, came outside and me and my sister  
was crying on the front porch. My oldest two brothers, they was gone running the streets in  
one of their friend's houses.  
And honestly, I'm just being transparent. My my oldest brother had tied me up, locked me in  
the room. It was it was the day of my mom's death.  
It was a rollercoaster because we're being abused by my oldest brother. My mom isn't  
responding to us. When we was finally able to make it to my mom's room, she was laying there.  
Blood running out of her mouth. It's all over her body. And we just asking, you know, calling  
her, trying to shake her, wake her up, not knowing at three years old what death was.  
Right. So we my sister and myself, we're on the front porch. We're crying.The neighbor come outside. He asked us, what's wrong? We said, my mama won't wake up. So  
he goes in the house.  
Go to my mom. I don't think my sister know was he shot past us. It was like three stairs.  
He ran down those stairs, went to his house where my mom's apartment was. It was maybe  
two minutes from the hospital. All we heard was sirens at that point.  
So we get there. I mean, the ambulance and what the first responders get there and they push  
past me and my sister, because again, we still sitting on the porch. They push past us.  
They go in the house. And next thing we know, my mom is coming out on a stretcher with a  
sheet over her. Hmm.  
Still, of course, not understanding what's going on. We just. Still sitting outside.  
They're not letting us in the house. They're yellow tape and everything. And I would say I'm just  
going to say maybe an hour or so later, I'm not really sure.  
My dad pulled up, OK? Yeah. Let me go back. Let me go back again.  
Let me go back again. All right. This is your story.  
Me, my sister and my oldest younger brother live with my dad. OK. His brother, my mom.  
So that morning, my dad had to be at work about eight o'clock that morning. He worked at  
Peavy's in Meridian, Mississippi. It was like one of those jobs that everybody had.  
That was like a good job. You know, it's like the warehouse, the plant or whatever. He worked  
up here with the speakers.  
So he kept us in his house. And my brother stayed at my at my mom's house. And so he  
dropped us off before work that morning and he was banging on the door for my mom to let  
us in.  
Mind you, since there was a separation there, I guess, you know, he felt like my mom was being  
petty and not answering the door for that morning. So got it. My oldest brother ended up  
opening the door and letting us in.  
My dad fixed us breakfast every morning and sent it over to my mom's house so that she didn't  
have to cook breakfast for us. And I really feel like, you know, he did that because he knew of  
my mom's illness. So he had to prepare meals for us to go over to my mom's house.  
So my dad dropped us off at my mom's apartment and she was already deceased. So he. He  
leaves work.  
To the news of Alma passed away. And so my dad pulled up to the house. Again, he's just sittingin his car.  
He didn't get out the car. He's parked across the street smoking his cigarette. And that's that's  
all I remember of my mom the day that my mom died.  
I didn't attend my mom's funeral because they said we was too young. So the last image in my  
head of my mom was her laying in her bed with blood running out of her mouth and, you  
know, and everywhere because she was eating. She had food in her room.  
And so. Yeah. No.  
And again, thank you for sharing that for. You know that that the details within that. To say a  
lot.  
Y'all three younger kids, four. In a house for with a deceased body that just happens to be your  
mother, that y'all don't know how long it's been getting abused at that same time simply  
because that's what your brother saw. So he was repeating behaviors that he saw, and he  
didn't have anybody else to repeat them on except for his younger siblings.  
Mm hmm. Yeah, it was. Guys, this is what we call generational curses.  
And if you have to think about a generational curse and things happening, this is a portion of  
where they start. But that ain't where they got to end. Yeah, it was one time my dad was at  
work and my brother stuck up.  
The oldest brother stuck up a stick in a bed. Oh, it's rolling up the stick and he's stuck it in my  
bed. And so I had blisters all over my body.  
And so this was before my mom passed away. So it was it was a lot of things that we endured  
while my dad was at work trying to provide for his family, leaving leaving me in my younger the  
younger three, which is his children at home with my mom, who had mental health issues in  
the oldest sibling being. I did.  
I did. Yeah. So we experienced a lot of abuse, not from my mom, but from my oldest brother.  
And again, like I don't have anything against my brother. I love him to death. We have a good  
relationship.  
I don't. I don't we don't even talk about the things that transpired when we was little. I've never  
even questioned him about any of those things, because I also witnessed the abuse that he  
experienced from.  
So, you know, the things that he did to me don't even amount to the type of physical and verbal  
abuse that he has endured from his mom. And so when we don't even talk about it. OK, so let's  
let's get into after.Your mother passed away. Your grandmother at that time is is still alive. Your father is now a  
widowed father.  
Did your did your did y'all get separated at any point where your brother went back with his  
father and the three of you went back with y'all's father? Yes. So at this at this point, my oldest  
brother had to go. Well, all of us had to leave when my mom passed away.  
This is one of those things about my dad that was told to me. And he was a alcoholic. So he was  
a heavy drinker.  
And so when my mom passed away, he reverted back to. Well, he was already an alcoholic and  
still drinking. So this is just something that he went through.  
He'll be trying to cope with the loss of my mom because my dad told me as I got older, you  
know, he said that wasn't the plan. The plan was for him to work and my mom to raise the kids.  
And so his plan failed.  
He had to become a single father and try to navigate life with. Three toddlers and it's how my  
dad is. At the time, my dad hit us at age 42\.  
So he's about 45, 46, raising three toddlers. And so my brother's dad took him and we went  
with our dad. But first, my mom's siblings kept my oldest brother and her mom kept me and  
my sister and my brother.  
And I kind of say when I I call my brother the brother by my dad. I love my brother. But when  
I'm speaking, I'm talking about the one I was raised with versus the one.  
Yeah. So the oldest went with his dad. And then all of us went with our dad.  
My mom's mother. Had to, you know, talk to my dad and tell him that, you know, she's getting  
older. You know, she can't raise three kids.  
Then basically he had to get his shit together because, you know, this is your maternal  
grandmother. My maternal grandmother. OK, she she kept us for as long as she could.  
And she told my dad that, you know, it's his turn. Like you got you need to get sober. You need  
to raise your children.  
They need you. My grandmother was sick. She was ill.  
And so my mom died when I was three. And then two years later, my maternal mother passed  
away. And so that was the second death that I had to experience in my lifetime.  
And so let's let's paint this picture for everybody. OK, quickly, three years old. Well, up until the  
point of three years old, witnessing physical and verbal abuse on a sibling.  
Not necessarily understanding what is going on. Seeing that sibling reciprocate that abuse andpass it down to them being having a father that's an alcoholic doing the best he can with what  
he knew. And what he had at the time, being in a home with your mother deceased, not  
knowing it that same day.  
Being abused by your brother, locked in the closet, adding insults to injury. And then on top of  
that. After everything is said and done, a bunch of confusion on who's going where, who's  
being taken care of for them, not having any type of real foundation.  
As a kid and having to live through all of that and keep going and keep pressing and then finally  
get with someone who has the stability only for two years later for tragedy to strike. Yet again,  
that. You know, they always say that God will never put more on you than you can bear.  
But then it's like, man, he must have brought two bears. Yeah. Yeah.  
My mom, my grandma died on Christmas Day. Christmas Day. Yeah.  
I want to say it was 1995, December 25th, 1995\. My mom's siblings knocked on my dad's door  
and. Let him know that Ivor Allen was gone.  
Now, at this time, how long had you been living back with your dad? So I don't have an  
adequate timestamp because. I just have to go based off of my memory. To me, it was my  
memory.  
I never missed a beat with my dad. I only knew I was with my grandmother because relatives  
told us that before we got back to my dad, we had to be with my grandmother for a while. So  
that part of my memory is not there.  
I just remember living with my daddy. That's an important fact that you bring up, guys, because  
a lot of times as as kids, we go through trauma. And then as we get older, that trauma is still  
affecting us.  
But because we have buried it somewhere within our mind, we can't really pinpoint why we are  
the way we are. And so what happens is some people call you crazy. Some people say ignorant.  
Some they call you all types of names, talk about you behind your back and things like that. And  
we don't go to therapy. We as a people on, for the most part, do not go to therapy.  
Because we're supposed to be so tough, get over it. So I'm here to let you guys know that I  
promise you. There were some actions and reactions in Ned's life that she had.  
That were caused by the trauma that she suppressed. And she didn't even know she was  
suppressing it. It was just suppressed within her, put out, put out of her memory so that she  
wouldn't have to go back and relive it.  
But these are the things as a as a people, as a human race. These things happen more often  
than not, where we are affected tremendously. By trauma, that is that we don't evenremember.  
She just said it here. As far as I knew, I was with my dad all the time. But family remembers  
otherwise.  
So I say that to say if there's some things going on in your life and you don't understand why,  
go talk to somebody that is licensed, that can deal with these types of things, that can pull stuff  
out of you. That's still living somewhere within your subconscious. And causing you to react in  
certain ways or not react.  
That is also potentially holding you back. So that I wanted to drop that in there, because that's  
something that a lot of us miss quite a bit. And we just we get labeled.  
And those labels carry with us all through life, so we don't get lessons, we don't get the  
treatment that we really need, we get labels. And those labels then form who other people  
think we are. So let's keep going, man.  
Grandmother passes away Christmas Day. What a present. Yeah.  
So at this time, when my grandmother passed away, we all I had a with. Truthfully, I never had  
a relationship with my mother's mom. If I my my mama's mama had 14 children.  
We have is about maybe 30 to 36 grandchildren. So having a close knit relationship with my  
mother's mom, it was rolling deep. So it really wasn't a close relationship.  
So we did go to the funeral, but it wasn't. I can't say that it was like impactful for me, because I  
knew my dad's mom to be my grandmother. I knew I had a grandmother through my mom,  
but it was we didn't have a close relationship.  
So when I was told that me and my siblings had to go live with my grandmother, there was  
news to me. So I can't say that I'm grateful for my grandmother standing in the gap while my  
dad get, you know, his life together to be able to raise me and my siblings, because we could  
have easily went into the foster system if it wasn't for her. So although I couldn't understand it  
as a child, me being 31 years old, reflecting back on my life, at times, you know, I understand,  
like she played a important role in my life, because if everybody would have said no, we  
wouldn't have to go to the system.  
So although I didn't have a relationship with her, I do appreciate the fact that she did that for  
my dad and my mom. Got it. So now we're we're age five, we're a little bit beyond the toddler  
side, we're adolescent now.  
We're we're living with your paternal grandmother. At this time, we still in Mississippi. Yes, I was  
still in Mississippi.  
I never lived with my paternal grandmother. I would I just live briefly with my maternal  
grandmother. Gotcha.Gotcha. OK. OK.  
I'm sorry about that. So let's go age five to 11\. What was life like for you at those times? So my  
dad was the type of father that he didn't run the streets, he didn't have company, he didn't  
have a girlfriend.  
His life was surrounded by me and my siblings. He was working at Peavey for far, far as I can  
remember. And then his back went out.  
When his back went out, he had ended up getting laid off from the job. And so that was a  
setback for my dad, because that was the place that he wanted to retire it. And so it was one  
night, it was one morning.  
My dad was his alarm went off to go to work. And he had to lay down because the back was  
gone. He heard my brother's alarm go out because he was he had to get up and get ready for  
school before us.  
By the time he heard my brother's alarm go off, he started screaming and yelling. And so my  
brother ran in the room and he had, I don't know if he called 911 or he called my dad's mom.  
But he ended up having to go into the hospital because his back went out.  
He couldn't get up out the bed that morning. And so we ended up having to go and stay with  
my grandmother while my dad go through, you know, I don't know if he had surgery, but  
whatever he had to go through during that time, we had to go to my grandmother's house.  
And so my grandmother made my brother stay with my dad.  
And so during this time, my dad was not a fan of hospitals. He wasn't a fan of doctors. So what  
he felt like was best for him was to go back to alcohol.  
Mind you, my whole entire life, when my mom died, when my dad got us, he went through  
rehab. He did not drink at all. So I just know my dad to be just a super dad.  
You know, he came with the work, came home, helped us with homework, made our food. I  
didn't have to clean up nothing. I didn't have to wash my own clothes.  
All I had to do was drop my book bag off at the door and run outside and play. My dad did not  
require anything of us. I'm learning that that wasn't a good thing as I got older.  
But at the time, as a kid, my daddy handled everything. He had to take on the role of daddy. He  
had to take on the role, not mama, but the things that a woman would do in the house, he had  
to take care of those things.  
But so he started back drinking. Never, never saw my dad drink. And at this point in time, I  
didn't know that he was drunk.  
I didn't know what drinking was. You know how you have corner stores that have the painhandlers out there, people asking for a dollar. But I never knew until I got older.  
And matter of fact, my sister pointed it out to me. She said, Nate, do you realize that daddy  
never pulled up to any of those gas stations? I was like, no. What are you talking about? Any gas  
station that was in the hood had people hanging out.  
My daddy did not take us there. Any parts of people being drunk, you know, on drugs and  
alcohol. My dad did not take us there.  
And so it was probably because it was a trigger for him. Right. So I didn't experience a drunk.  
So my dad was drinking, but my sister got a whiff of what was going on. I didn't get the whiff of  
what was going on. All I knew was.  
Granny said we couldn't go back home. Now, I did see, you know, he was snoring a lot when I  
was seeing him, he was passed out, but I'm thinking that's it. I'm thinking, you know, maybe,  
you know, he's tired.  
He's trying to recover. I could hear him arguing back and forth with my grandmama about  
things. But we did have to stay in the child's place.  
So anything that was going on to make my dad look bad or wrong folks business, we had to  
stay out of. So my grandmama, before she would argue with my daddy, she would snatch us  
and leave. Because we was not my.  
My dad was born in 1948\. We can't. We were raised through an era of, you know, wrong folks  
business.  
If the neighbor says something to you, you better stop. They're going to tell you. Right.  
My dad is not going to ask me what I did. He's going to take the neighbor's word because that's  
how he was. You know, he grew up.  
So. Yeah. I don't know.  
I didn't know that my dad was drinking at the time. I know now as an adult that what was going  
on. My daddy ended up going to a hospital.  
They just said they see, you know, he in the hospital. My dad was in the rehab center. You got it.  
Got it. So he had to recover from that. And after he got out of rehab and he detox, he ended up  
getting us back.  
And the show was on the road. We was back, you know, big happy family. My dad is good.  
He did lose his job. He ended up working at a school as a janitorial. So that's why I made a post  
years ago.Is that the same amount of respect as a seat for a CNO CEO? If I do for my dad, it was a janitor  
at a county school for a few years. And so that's how life was. My dad couldn't do no wrong.  
I feel like he was my Superman. He did have that one setback, but he had people around him to  
shield his children from that. And the show was on the road from there.  
So he did have this setback. But I don't feel like it just impacted my life to the point where it was  
traumatizing because my grandmama was there to make sure that my daddy got got back  
together, got detox, got his children back, and we was on the road. You know, I have to hold  
back some emotions as you're talking about this part of the story.  
Because I was your dad for a little while to my kids. Where. By 530, six o'clock, I'm sitting in one  
of the recliners and I'm passed out in the middle of a conversation with my middle child.  
And the only thing I remember after I got clean. Wanting just praying that as she gets older,  
she doesn't remember any of those parts of me. And that I eradicated so much that nobody  
else in the family ever talks about it to them.  
As they get older. So I like I'm sitting here and I'm listening to you, and there's a million  
emotions running through me. Wondering how much.  
Of a negative effect, did my alcoholism have on my kids during that time? I didn't mean to say,  
you know. I didn't mean to say anything about that. You know, as a child, we would always go  
to my granny on my daddy's side.  
She cooked for Thanksgiving, Christmas, Mother's Day. Easter. So that was one of the times  
where all of her children came to her house.  
She lived on a street where everybody in my daddy grew up with. They was, you know,  
everybody's family was on 18th Avenue and Meridian. All of the older people's family came.  
And so, you know, all of the friends that he had, you know, they would come over to my  
grandma's house and, you know, just catch up. All of them had a past. But I remember one  
time one of his friends came over to holler at my daddy.  
And so I went outside because I always, because for one, like I said, my daddy, when I grew up,  
my daddy didn't have no friends. Nobody visits the home. No girlfriend.  
It was just us, just the four of us. Just Charlie and his kids. And so whenever I would see  
somebody come and talk to my daddy, I want to know, how do you know my daddy? Because  
he ain't got no friends.  
I remember one time I went outside and I guess they was talking about the olden days. And so  
all I know is my daddy turned around, seeing me like I was a ghost, and he said, hey man, be  
quiet. And I'm like, you know, well, what they talking about? But daddy, everybody that was  
around my daddy knew who my daddy was back in the day.They could not talk about their life in front of his children. Right. If they talked about anything  
other than the man that he was during that day, it was going to be a problem.  
And you didn't hear about it. You didn't hear about it. So of course, you know, when I was in  
Detroit this past weekend and there's been a few other times, even when siblings, it was five,  
my daddy had five, four other siblings.  
One of them recently passed away last year, but prior to that, my daddy was the only one that  
was gone. And so when I tell you respect resonated for years and years at a time, I'm 31 years  
old and I can still go in the room with my daddy's siblings or his cousin and be like, Hey, who,  
who, who was, you know, that man ain't nobody talking. He still, they still to this day would not  
say anything about who my daddy was prior to his children.  
Right. Yeah. When I was in Detroit, I said, listen, I told one of his cousins, I told I said, listen, I'm  
tired of y'all.  
I'm tired of y'all. I say, I want to know. All she said was your daddy was a wild boy.  
What did she do? Um, I still know, you know, I just still know him to be the man that he was.  
Um, so yeah, we can move around, move along the timeline. I'm uh, I'm interested to see what  
my friends are going to say to my kids.  
They can have that same statement without a doubt. They could have that same statement. So  
before we, before we move on into teenage years, um, which get interesting guys, because  
Ned's life took another turn at that point.  
Um, and, and I won't necessarily say it was a turn for the better. So there was some other trials  
and tribulations and knowing now the backstory here of her toddler years and adolescence, I  
understand a little bit more why it took some of the turn that it took. But what I'll do right now  
is we'll take a brief, uh, what we'll call a commercial break is Quan in the building.  
Where are you at Quan? Grace is with your presence, please, ma'am. I'm here. There we go.  
There we go. So we're going to turn it over to Quan for a little bit here while we take a small  
intermission and let Quan come over and bless us for a second. And we'll be back in just a  
moment.  
Quan the floor is yours, ma'am. And we'll be back to continue on with the story. Hello everyone.  
It's nice seeing y'all. So I am enjoying the story. I've been knowing it a while, but I didn't know  
even some of the, um, those things about her.  
So it just makes me respect her even more. So shout out to you, Nick. You know, we, all of you,  
you have played such a major part in everyone's life on this video.  
Um, so y'all just a hand clap for, um, for Nick. Cause she's so strong and she has endured somuch, but she still pours so much back into each and every one of us. So I truly love Nick just  
for being so strong, so loving, so caring, like, you know, and she has been through so much.  
Like I couldn't even imagine. I still have both of my parents. I loved them dearly.  
And my mom just recently had surgery and I didn't think that I was going to be able to make it.  
She was stronger than me. So just shout out to Nick for just being a real friend, a real sister, a  
real supporter.  
Like she has each and every one of y'all's back as well as mine. So y'all know I love Nick. She's  
my little big sister.  
But, um, I just wanted to come on and encourage you guys to, um, keep doing what you're  
doing, whatever you have to do to get this group home started. Hello, honey. Whatever you  
have to do to get this group home started as well as me, I'm super supportive as well.  
I will help each one of you in any way that I can. And I know a lot of you have the, um, trouble of  
saying that you don't have the money to start a group home. So that inspired me a little bit as  
well as Nick was just sitting down talking one day.  
And she knows that I am always marketing so hard, even when I'm full just to help refer other  
people out. So she was like, Juan, you should have started a placement agency. That'll help a lot  
of people, you know, do not have the money to start a group home.  
So I did it. Um, I was placing so many people and I was like, I was just giving them away. Um,  
and I was like, you know what? This could be another stream of income.  
So I started charging, um, a placement fee. Um, it was a small fee. It was only $300.  
That's how I started out. But within one week after I started charging, I placed 10 people. So  
that means I made a sum of $3,000 in one week just for making phone calls and getting out,  
doing a little work to make sure that the homes that I was sending the people to were, um,  
good home, clean homes, stable homes.  
So what I did was I shared it for the first time at the Detroit conference. Um, I have an ebook.  
So I wrote an ebook on how to start a placement agency.  
Um, the ebook is on sale right now. Um, it's 30% off right now. Um, I'll put the link down below,  
but I started it because it helps a lot of you all because a lot of you always say, well, I don't have  
the money to start a group home.  
I don't know how to start it without the money. I work a full time job, so I don't have the time to  
start a group home. So for me, this is the answer to your problem.  
It is definitely a solution because in the ebook, I tell you everything that I do from start to finish,  
um, on how to start a placement agency, what a placement agency is. Some of you call it asenior coordinator, but it depends on your target audience, but I do it for seniors. So like I said,  
it tells you a little bit of my story, where I'm from, why I started, some things that I went  
through in the group home business.  
Um, there is a contract that is also in the ebook, um, that you can copy and paste, print it off  
and use it for yourself. If you want to start the placement agency, um, the contract itself was  
created by an attorney. So it's an, it is a legit contract.  
So basically it just lets you know that you and whoever you are referring to, um, the resident to,  
whether it be the group home, um, you're basically just going to take your information and put  
it down. They'll fill in the blanks for their information. It has to, um, it's listed the, basically the  
resident's name, date of birth, their diagnosis, what medicines they take.  
So you'll get to know everything about this person before you can place them because you  
want to place them in the right place. I'm going to put the link to the ebook in the comments or  
Nick can one of y'all put it in there for me? Um, it basically tells you, hold on just a second y'all.  
I'm going to send her a link so that she can put it in there.  
Okay. That's done. So it basically tells you, um, how to start an agency, how much money you  
can make starting an agency.  
Like I said, the contract is in there, but it's easy because it costs $0 job. It didn't cost one dime  
for me to start this. The only thing I did was put out maybe two hours out of the day, um, for a  
week and it paid off very quickly.  
So I, now I still do it. And I make about nine K a month with, um, or more sometimes doing it.  
Now my starting price was $300 when I first started, but that was for anyone that was $1,200  
and under.  
Now I do $300 for 1,200 and under for anything that is over 1,200. I charged $500 anything that  
is over $2,500 I charged $800, but it is a way for you guys who do not have the money. Can you  
hear me now? Okay.  
So I guess it's just her because everybody else can hear me, but it is a way for you guys who  
don't have money to start. Um, so you're basically just going to get out, put in the work and  
meet these social workers, these case managers, the same people who are referring the people  
to us in the group home, you're going to get out and you're going to make relationships with  
those people. And so with doing that by starting the placement agency first, when you get your  
money, cause you're going to get your money.  
Like I told y'all, I made $3,000 my first week of doing this. So if you do it for one month and you  
put in the work, like I put in the work and you can get $9,000 in one month, it only takes about  
6,000 to $8,000 to start a group home. They in inbox me for budgeting tilts.  
Cause you know, I got y'all big and that $8,000 includes your rent, your deposit, all of thedeposits for your utilities, any furniture, any appliances that you have to get. You can do all of  
that with $8,000 a list. So if you start the placement agency first, then you use that biz that  
money from that business to fund a group home business.  
Now you've got the placement agency that's generating you a monthly revenue and it has  
started, you start, gave you the money to start your group home. So by you having the money  
to start that group home, you've already created a relationship with those case managers and  
those social workers. So you're already getting residents in.  
So when you open that group home, you furnish that group home on a budget, inbox me, I'm  
gonna help you. And once you get that group home open, you are going to fill it up quickly with  
no problem. Why? Because you already build their relationship with that case manager and that  
social worker.  
You're already learning how to market. You're already learning how to do follow up calls, follow  
up emails. You're already learning how to assess a resident.  
So when you get ready to open that group home business, you're going to soar without any  
problems because you've already built those necessary relationships. And if any of y'all are in  
the state of Texas or in Houston area, if y'all need my help, DM me, because once y'all get this  
going and y'all get y'all group home open, y'all are going to need a team of people who you can  
trust around your residents. So I will hook y'all up with my psychiatrist, my personal care  
provider.  
I'll hook y'all up with my hospice agency, my home healthcare agency. I'll hook y'all up with my  
pharmacist. They deliver like I'll do all of this for y'all.  
I don't want y'all to give me any money for doing it. I just want to see all of y'all wins. So when  
someone gives to me, I'm the type of person that if you give me 10, I'm going to give a  
thousand to everybody else.  
So Nick gave me 10\. This is my way of giving y'all a thousand plus more and y'all be DMing me  
all the time. I try to get to every DM that I can, but by the time I finished y'all, I'd be a little tired,  
but I do answer DMs for at least an hour.  
So if y'all go ahead and DM me now, I'm going to start answering those deals, but I'm going to  
be done by 10\. But I can tell y'all that this method works in every state because it was one lady.  
I'm not going to call her name cause she might not want y'all in her business, but it was one  
lady that bought my, she brought my ebook.  
She called me. She asked me a couple of questions. After I answered those questions for her,  
three days after we made it back from the Detroit conference, she DM me and I put the DM up  
so y'all could see it.  
And the comment is also in the post, but she already got a call to play nine residents. Y'all dothe math. Nine and she started out with $300.  
That's $2,700 and she just started this. She hasn't even been doing it a week. She was able to  
generate $2,700 in just a couple of days.  
So y'all don't sleep on other businesses that you could outsource and do in the group home  
business. It's so many businesses that you can pull out of having a group home. So for me, I'm  
doing a basement agency.  
It is successful. I got the fifth group home within a year and I'm in the middle of opening a  
hospice agency. So y'all it's so much money in this.  
And like I said, I created the ebook because I haven't always been, you know, financially stable  
having as much money as I can in the bank. So I had to start from somewhere. So I feel like this  
is a great way for you guys to get us to get a start, to take the knowledge, DM me, if y'all have  
details and soar with it and feel those group homes up and keep opening them and opening  
and opening and opening so that within a year, it can be you on one of these videos or it can be  
you at the conference, teaching people what has been poured into you.  
So I think that's my time. Oh, my name on Facebook is Quan Shantae, Q-U-A-N-S-H-A-N-T-A. Net  
dead.  
She just posted the link to the ebook in the comments. And like I said, it is on sale now. It's 30%  
off, but y'all make a small investment in yourself because the contract itself costs more than the  
ebook.  
So it is well worth the money. And if you have any questions pertaining to the ebook, just DM  
me. And I was just getting ready to say that, Quan.  
I know our attorney on the low end is like 375 an hour. And so like we just got through doing a  
contract for a company that we were buying. And I mean, before we knew it, we were up at  
$6,000, just for phone conversations and him drafting contracts for us.  
But if y'all thought I was going to just let Quan slide some of them gems in there and not come  
back and highlight some of them, y'all don't know me. Y'all don't know me that well. Guys, what  
I heard Quan say was that you don't have any excuses.  
That's what I heard. Okay. Throughout all of this, this is what I, this is what I heard.  
So let's look exactly at what she did. She found somebody that was in a higher up statute than  
her doing what she wanted to do. She latched on to that person by providing value to them.  
That's part of the story that y'all don't know, but I've heard from that. So she latched on by  
providing value to her. And in turn, that value that she provided was sweat equity in her own  
sense to go and learn and do this.And through that, the hustler mentality also came through that said, Hey, I need to make more  
money to get started. What are some other verticals that I can utilize to start making money  
before I get what I want? So she planted her seeds before she gathered her harvest. She didn't  
try to go gather a harvest without first planting seeds, which is what a lot of us want in life.  
We want the harvest, but we don't want the garden. We don't want the gardeners role because  
that's the part that sucks. And so what I'm saying here is before you get the harvest, you got to  
guard.  
You got to go till the ground. You got to plant the seed. You got to water it daily.  
And then when you start to do that, you know, before it, this is, this is, it's called gravitropic or  
gravitropic. Okay. What that means is that the roots start growing down first.  
So you may not see it. And other people may not see it as you going out there every day and  
gardening and watering and tilling, but guess what growth is happening. It's just growing in a  
way that you don't see it just yet.  
But then as you continue on, you then hit the next stage of what Quan was able to hit, which is  
called phototropic. That's when the seed now spurts up out of the ground and you're able to  
see a little bit. And now, now you're getting a little bit more encouraged because you're seeing  
it and everybody else is starting to see it as well.  
So let me tell you guys something that are going through this right now in your gravitropic  
stage in life. Don't quit. Just because you can't see it because it's not sprouting up over ground  
and you can't really go talk to your friends and everybody else about it because they can't see it  
either.  
You better not stop. You better not stop gardening. I promise you that you better not stop  
gardening.  
So Quan, thank you. Thank you for blessing us with those gems that you just put out there for  
us and allowing us to use some metaphors to come back and put all that together so they can  
really see what you went through and how you did this and where you are right now. So guys, if  
you don't have the book and you don't have a home and you're posting in there time and time  
again, are there any grants? Are there, how can I get startup money? Quan just told you how to  
get startup money and then how much it's going to cost you to turn that startup money into a  
home.  
Yes. There are no excuses. There are no excuses.  
Quan, thank you, ma'am. I cannot wait to see you in Dallas. Oh, you all are welcome.  
And I cannot wait to see y'all in Dallas because y'all know I'm going to drop those budgeting  
tips on y'all. My grocery store budgeting tips. Tell them.All right, y'all. So I'm ready to get back to this story. I'm tuning in.  
I got my snacks over here. So now guys, it's time for us to dive into some of the teenage years.  
We know for those of you that are just joining us, if you came in late or missed a portion of it,  
we learned about the backstory of how Nick grew up with a father that was an alcoholic that  
she never knew was an alcoholic, a mother that had a mental challenge that while she didn't  
experience, some of the beatings and things like that and verbal abuse, her oldest brother did  
her oldest brother then turned around and started doing the same thing to her and her  
siblings.  
Okay. And then three years old in a house with a mother who was deceased for we don't know  
how long. Blood coming out of mouth, ants covering her body, a neighbor having to come in,  
recognize what was happening.  
Sirens blaring because they're two minutes away from the hospital. And then heard the next,  
the next scene that she sees of her mother is her being willed out of the house with a sheet  
covering her, passed away, having to then go and live with her father. Also having her maternal  
grandmother step in and take care of her as well until the maternal grandmother said, baby,  
I'm too old for this.  
And having to go back and give her back to her father. And then at five years old, Christmas  
day, learning that this lady that took them in after the passing of her mother has now been  
deceased as well. And then transitioning on through the years of her dad, her never knowing  
her dad was an alcoholic because he knew he had some responsibilities, all but one instance  
where he had to go to the hospital.  
You know, our family's love, you know, putting, putting a story together to make it seem less  
than what it is. Thank God for my grandmama because you have people that's in your family  
that will tell you them and tell you, tell all your business. Cause I got, I got a mother's side and I  
got a daddy's side.  
And, um, I don't have the best relationship with people on my mama's side, but had it been my  
mama's side and which it was my mama's side, they told it, you know? So you just have, you  
know, uh, this, you know, different family members, they want to make sure you are protected.  
They want to make sure that, you know, your, your secrets are, uh, safe with them. And then  
you have some family members that want to, uh, rain on your parade.  
So, uh, my dad's side was definitely, and he wasn't nothing to play with. So, uh, they knew not  
to say that. But done.  
I know we're going to jump into the next topic. I mean, the next thing, but my twin sister has  
been watching this video from the beginning. And so while we was on commercial break, she  
texted me and she told me, she was like, Nick, you didn't tell her right.  
And, um, because you know, the emotional thing. So I asked my sister, did she mind coming into really just paint the picture? Come on up. Are you here? Can you hear me? I can hear you.  
Yeah. I, um, I was listening at the time period, I guess y'all say five to 11 and she briefly hit on  
about my, um, dad and him were burned back to alcohol when he got ill. But, um, I guess he  
remembered too much.  
I didn't want to say, but I just want to let you all know like the morning of after he called my  
brother and we came in there and we was wondering like, dad, why you stay here? You must be  
aware. Cause we wrote the bus from school. My grandma come get us and watch us on the  
school bus stop.  
And so that morning, um, his back went out and so we went on to school, but we normally  
would get on the school bus, come home and my grandma would be waiting on this to take us  
to her house. But since my dad back was out for a little while, we will get off the bus and just  
come straight in the door. And so there were several days when we would go inside the house,  
what we would know as, you know, home and they felt home.  
And we, you know, it was exciting to be home. We was walking into something that was  
gloomy. Um, you know, my dad would be passed out on the dining room floor.  
We had to walk over him to get to the bathroom or our room or wherever, or, you know, food  
wasn't cooked anymore. We try to talk to him and we didn't talk to him and we, you know, we  
would get scared and ask my grandma to come get us or whatever. And then, you know, that  
was an everyday thing.  
And one day she took him to the grocery store cause we still didn't know what was wrong. And  
we just thought he was sick, but she had took him to the grocery store and you know, he was  
asking my grandma what were all those cans that he had took to his room. Oh.  
And she said, if you, your daddy wanted you to know he had, you know, he'll tell you. So after a  
while, um, you know, things went on the same way. But one day when we got out of school, I  
saw a can and I saw it said, um, Old Milwaukee, but I didn't know what that was.  
And now, you know, I'm searching reading that can top to bottom trying to figure out what it is.  
And they said, American spray tasting beer. And so that's when, you know, I was telling my  
sister, daddy drinking beer.  
And my brother, he said, I already knew that. And so we, you know, he always preached to us  
and talked to us, but he was, he was just telling my brother that things that he was, he has  
done in the past wasn't good. And me and my sister sitting in the room while my daddy talked  
in the dining room, he was repeating over and over that.  
You saw a good seed, you reap, you saw a bad seed, you get a bad seed. So you reap it. He just  
kept saying that over and over and over.And then do you remember that? Yeah. I'm walking down the damn hallway, listening to it now.  
Uh, that was just one of the things I think I blocked out until you said that because, um, uh, now  
that my sister mentioned the cans, I remember us going into that refrigerator because my dad  
didn't buy soda water.  
You know, he didn't buy us sprites in the can. We had jug juice. And so we seen cans in the  
damn refrigerator.  
So we like, what's fear. I, I, now I remember, you know, and, and she jogged my memory. I  
remember now I'm going into the refrigerator and seeing can, can something to drink in the  
refrigerator and it wasn't juice.  
Uh, but we never did consume any of it, but I do remember seeing it, um, and seeing all of that.  
Um, it was just probably something that was, you know, probably it was just blocked out of my  
mind up until now. Um, but I do, my grandmama did, we was young.  
So my grandmama came over in the morning times, uh, waited outside till the bus came for us  
to get to and from school every day. And, um, it did shift it, you know, at that point in time, but I  
didn't, I didn't remember it until now. So I do appreciate my sister for, um, jogging my memory.  
I don't know if I appreciate it, but I do remember. Okay. Let me, let's, let's get some, some ones  
in the chat.  
If portions of your childhood were like nets in any way, maybe not as severe, but it caused  
some trauma in your life, both known and unknown that you're now just starting to uncover  
some of the stuff that you were going through. And the memories are now coming back  
because you're older. So we got a lot of people in here that are related to you, Ned.  
I just wanted to see that fact of, because we all go through some things, man. And usually  
again, it's not until we get a little bit older that they start to get uncovered. And we don't realize  
that childhood trauma is, is a real, real, real thing.  
But the body and the mind protects us quite a bit by blocking some of it out. But it's really not  
protecting us because the fallout comes when you're older and you don't recognize or  
understand why you do some of the things that you do, where it came from. It shows up.  
Mine showed up in my drink. My dad was an alcoholic and I decided that I wanted to be  
alcoholic junior. It's man.  
I ain't gonna lie. My dad had told me right before he transitioned. And this is the God and his  
truth.  
He said, Ned, don't ever take your first drink. He told me, he said, Ned, basically I had a  
predisposition. His family, all of his brothers, they were all alcoholics.  
And I'm not talking about alcoholics that drink and, you know, function alcoholic. I'm talkingabout stone cold fools that would get drunk, pass out in the middle of a goddamn highway.  
Cause my dad and them wasn't, wasn't playing.  
And I adopted this a little bit. Like when I'm having me a real, real good time and I'm drinking,  
uh, they'll be like, you know, you need to eat some, Ned, you need to drink some. My uncle told  
me if you eat or you drink water while you drinking, you try to put the fire out.  
And I tell him, listen, I ain't trying to put the fire out. Like if you trying to drink, you don't drink.  
That's how these people live.  
They weren't trying to put the fire out. And so I understand what they be saying, but when I'm  
having a good time and I'm trying to get to where I'm going, I'm not having a fun. I'm like, look,  
I'm not like my uncle said, putting the fire out tonight.  
It happens, happens, but I ain't never got, you know, to that point. But him telling me that  
caused me to hold out on alcohol until I turned 21 and my sister on his life. And, but my sister  
was drinking.  
I want to say she, we was in maybe 10th or 11th grade. I was seeing Boone's forms in her dress  
and I'm like what the heck is going on. So tell your story, tell your story.  
$2.99, $2.99 cents worth of fun. Early. And I used to say like, this is crazy.  
But he did tell us, he was like, you know, my daddy didn't want us to drink. He told me never  
take my first drink. But of course, you know, you know, I tell my, you know, he, after he passed  
away, you know what I'm saying? I did it for my dad, but I, I, I enjoyed my little drink.  
But anyway, he did tell us that. And for that reason, it was just because he was, um, a stoned  
alcoholic. It wasn't, he didn't turn down.  
Uh, he went to work Monday through Friday by before I was born. Cause this is some of the  
stuff he told me before he left. Uh, Monday through Friday, he was at work.  
Um, by Friday, by the time he clocked out, he drunk as much as he could possibly handle. Went  
into a detox center, back at work Monday morning. That was crazy.  
You got that loaded. You get that loaded to where you and your brothers go out, have a good  
time to where you got a detox. Go, go, go admit yourself before you go back to work Monday  
morning.  
That's crazy. So that's commitment. Committed drinker.  
Not to drink because it was on my mama's side, my mama and my daddy's side, you know, are  
alcoholics or whatever. But, um, luckily for me and my siblings, we aren't to that capacity. We  
do indulge a little bit, but we not like my daddy.So it's all understood, understood. So we got through about 11, 12 middle school nouns, what  
we're in, what changed for you at that point? Because we had a situation that you're going to  
come across here around the age of 13\. So around 12, age 12, what, what started happening?  
What started changing in your life that potentially caused you to act out or potentially led you  
to where you ended up getting, catching your first case? So, um, I grew up, um, in a household  
with my daddy and my daddy grew up in a household with people who came through an era of  
segregation.  
If you kill a black man, oh, well, if you kill a black woman, oh, well, that was, you know, what he  
grew up. Um, and so times had changed. Uh, and my dad was just resorting back to how things  
were when he was a child.  
And we often raise our children based on how our parents raised this. We often do our teaching  
based off of what our parents said. So I grew up with my daddy and he would always tell me,  
man, if somebody put their hands on you, you knock their ass out.  
You pick up whoever that's close and near to you and you beat their ass. He didn't, and he  
meant it, you know, he meant it. And so anytime before I was, before I turned 13 years old, I  
would get into my fights or whatever.  
And he was drilling to me, you know, he didn't, he didn't play losing the fight. He didn't play me  
coming into the house talking about, I lost the fight. Um, it was one time I came home and I  
was crying because, and it was a street fight, you know, he, he didn't, he didn't take too well of  
it because my dad was a short man.  
I think he was five foot two or five foot three. And if you all know short people feel like they got  
something to prove. They try to let you know, I might be short, but I ain't in the play with and  
he wasn't in the play with, with his short ass.  
Okay. And so I came home crying, had a black eye. And I said, daddy, you know, I'm crying to  
my daddy.  
Like I got in the fight. I didn't win. He, he tells me, what, what you telling me for? This is what he  
said.  
He said, what you telling me for? I told you what to do. He told me, he said, I told you what to  
do. What'd you tell me for my sister and my brother weren't people who were just necessarily  
fighters.  
I was a sibling that fought. If you mess with my sister, mess with my brother, you know, I was  
trained to, we, you know, it's always one. When I turned 13, um, there was some girls doing  
some picking.  
And so, um, I went to one of my friends' house. I was set up. So take the friend out, take the  
scratch the friend.I went to this girl's house. I was set up. We was, you know, arguing over the phone a little bit.  
She wanted me to come to her house. When I get there, uh, there were two girls there that, you  
know, I was arguing with early that day, you know, basically they wanted to fight. And I was like  
rough.  
You know, I was always rough. I was a tomboy, still is. Um, and I was scared to fight.  
I knew that I wasn't going to lose, you know, win everything or whatever, but I won't lose  
either. So I had a pep talk with my daddy. I knew that at this point, you know, I can't go home  
telling my dad, I got my ass whooped at this point.  
So, um, I was fighting this girl, getting the best of her. And then another girl jumped in. So I had  
a, um, nail filer with me.  
It's a metal nail filer. It's definitely better up here. It was a nail filer I just had in my pocket.  
And so as I'm fighting up one girl, this other girl jump in, I pull out my nail file and I start  
stacking. So I'm, I'm just doing what I was told to do. I'm, you know, get, get, get them up off of  
you, beat their ass, pick up whatever, whatever you got to use.  
Because at that point, my daddy was, you know, he was raised in an era where you didn't go to  
jail for that kind of stuff. You just had to go get your speeches. And that was it.  
So, um, I did all of that. And then my daddy, um, I went home and told my daddy, I had blood  
on my clothes. He was panicking and then are you okay? And I said, daddy, this ain't my blood.  
This the girl blood. And he, you know what I'm saying? He was like, shit, you know, well, you  
know, until the police come knocking at the door. The, uh, girl's mother that I stabbed pressed  
charges on me.  
And I got at 13 years old, I got the charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. So we  
just not going to skate over this net. Okay.  
13 years old, you beat somebody up, you stabbed them. You got them awfully. You did what  
your daddy told you to do, but your daddy didn't prepare you for the consequences.  
Okay. Okay. So that's, that's the other part of the story guys that, you know, our parents and as  
parents, we tell our kids what to do, how to handle the situation, but we don't necessarily  
always tell them how to deal with the consequences.  
That's going to come with how we told them how to handle. So it's like we set them up for  
failure, success and failure. So net the police are knocking at your door.  
What's going through your head right now? What's going, let us know. What was the, what was  
the fallout mentally of what's going on with you? Did you get arrested? What, what, what is,what's going on in your head right now at that time? At this time, the police is in my door. It's  
around the holidays.  
So it was like the Christmas holiday and my daddy, they talked to my daddy asking for me. And I  
just remember, uh, him saying, let me take her. So he didn't want me in handcuffs.  
Right. He took me down to the police station. There was this black detective.  
Um, there was this black detective. She took me, he took me down there. Um, it was about to  
be the holidays.  
And so she had told my daddy, he was, she said, well, what I do is after the holidays come and  
pass, um, you know, she'll have to turn herself in. I'm 13 years old. I'm not, I'm not really not  
processing anything because I don't feel like I'm in trouble.  
I don't know the reason why I feel like I, I don't feel like I'm in trouble. I knew I was in trouble,  
but I felt like since they were jumping me, you were in the right. I was in, I was in the clear  
because they was jumping me.  
But the law stated that if they didn't use a weapon, it don't matter if it was 10 girls on me, as  
long as they was only simple assaulting me, just using their hands. I could not use a weapon to  
turn it into aggravating. So the law said that it don't matter if it was two, you should have just  
fought me.  
I wasn't aware of it. I'm just like, I'm trying to get one of these girls on top of me. So after, after,  
and mind you, I still had a, uh, the meaning of like, you know, so what, you know, I had never  
been like the girl that was scared or whatever.  
So I'm just like, you know, and then my daddy there too, she, I'm like, and he was okay with the  
shit. Well, you know, like, so I'm just sitting there or whatever. So we leave, I go back to school.  
It was months, maybe about two months passed by. I knew that in my mind that I was have, I  
would have to go deal with this, what I did, but the detective never came back for me. So I really  
felt like I was in a clear.  
Okay. And I'm on the bus one day. Okay.  
So happy. One of the girls that I, uh, the girl that I stabbed cousin lived in my neighborhood.  
She rode the bus home, uh, with her cousin next day.  
So I'm on the bus minding my business. The girl that I stabbed and her cousin, you know, they  
all doing this chatter or whatever, you know, because I stabbed her, you know, so now she got  
her friends and everything. Um, so you know, they claimed that they wanted to fight again.  
So I'm okay. But we got off the bus, didn't nobody do nothing. But of course we had, we had  
went back and forth on the bus arguing or whatever.And I'm, you know, you can get it again. You know, I'm, no, no. So in the words of Jay Prince  
tongue wrestling.  
Yeah. I get off the bus. They want nothing.  
They want it again. So I go home, ride my bike, you know, 13 year old, ride her bike, mind her  
business. I seen the police pass my daddy's house.  
I was like, this ain't nothing of it. But subconsciously I'm like, I know I had to go back from what  
I did these girls on this bus today. So I'm kind of spooked a little bit.  
Yeah. So then, um, I ain't worried about it. So I was like, in my mind, I was like, if I can just get to  
my daddy's house, get in a door.  
So we had, everybody had an attic. I'm going to tell y'all like we had an attic, everybody had an  
attic. But in my mind, if this is going on, I'm just going to go in the house.  
My room led to the attic. I'm going to go up in the attic. And I'm just going to wait till my daddy  
get home because my daddy get out late.  
So I'm like, okay, I'm going to just run into the attic. Just in case something going on. So they  
can't find me.  
I was listening to, uh, Mr. Big take, take this shit to try. You know that song? I'm about to go to  
the attic. So I was like, if I can just get home.  
So I'm riding my bike home. Another police car passed. I'm like, shit.  
So I'm just like, they ain't, they ain't want me. I'm just, you know, riding my bike home to the  
house. Right.  
By the time I made it to my daddy stayed on the corner lot. By the time I made it to the damn  
corner, police get out the car, both of them. But this back, this back with everybody playing that  
side, right? So all my friends in the neighborhood, we all outside riding our bikes.  
So I'm gotta be hard, whatever. So they asked me what my name was. I told him what my name  
was.  
I had to get off my bike. They put me in handcuffs. My dad is still at work.  
So, you know, he didn't have no cell phone. So he been had to get off work, pull up to knowing  
that his daughter got my, um, they put me in the car. I think I had a cell phone though.  
So I'm in the handcuffs in the back texting my sister, texting them like, you know, whatever,  
whatever. They got me. I go to the police station.  
I go to juvenile. It was on a Tuesday. A juvenile court in Mississippi in Meridian was every, no,it's on a Monday.  
So juvenile court was on Tuesday, Thursday, back home. So I didn't know the time, but, um, I  
went to juvenile on Monday and then on Tuesday I had a hearing. On a Tuesday I had my  
hearing.  
And so I ended up being able to go home, but the charge was aggravated assault with a deadly  
weapon. I don't know what that mean at 13 years old. You know what I'm saying? All right.  
You know, they asked me, did I do it? I told him, yeah, because at the time I'm saying I got  
jumped. So I'm a mean to everything. Right.  
I go to court, get through all of that. Um, the only thing that I had, my dad had to do was pay  
her medical bills. But, uh, you know, them, them hoes was on Medicaid.  
So it wasn't a medical bills, but, um, that's the only thing. So that's, that's what the judge said.  
He said, you know, um, you ain't have to address them like that, but I, when I go back home, I'd  
be like, yeah, yeah.  
Okay. But that was jumping me done. They were right.  
I feel you. Whatever. So all I had to do was pay that medical.  
My dad had to pay that medical bills. And so, like I said, it was my Christmas time. So it was  
income tax time.  
So my dad was like, you know, he'll put his whole damn return on it. They'll never be as long as  
baby girl. They free.  
So I didn't have to, um, I ain't, I ain't have to pay nothing for that. So I was like, cool. So that was  
first charge.  
You ended up getting a serious charge that led to a slap on the wrist. So is it safe to say that a  
lesson wasn't learned? Oh, for sure. For sure.  
Cause all I did is, at that point I just had one night in juvenile. Right. That was the worst of it.  
Yeah. Your daddy was okay with it. So subconsciously you were okay with it.  
And then you back all of that up with the fact that it now looks like the justice system is okay  
with it. Let's keep going. Where did that lead to after this? So that was at 13\.  
So in 14, I had my first child, wait, wait, at 15, I had my, I got pregnant with my first child. Okay.  
So, you know, like I said, I ain't gonna leave, I ain't gonna hold no punches.  
We got, we're starting with criminal activity after a rougher childhood that leads into a slap on  
the wrist, which then leads us into some premarital sex at a very young age, unprotected, thatled to a pregnancy. When we are now thinking about all of this, and we know that we have a  
father that don't play, who was also raising kids on his own. And now we have to put the feeling  
on him and the, and all the emotions that come with now also being a grandfather and  
potential father figure in a sense to a child that's being brought in this world by his 15 year old.  
How did all that play out? All right. So at this point, my dad, we talked about him working in a,  
um, in janitorial. Right.  
And so mind you, I had fights in every, um, grade I was in. I can't remember my first fight, but  
every year after my first fight, I had a fight in every school year. Like I went to my next grade  
ready for somebody to say something.  
So at this particular time, it was like, we didn't even get through breakfast in the cafeteria. And  
say something to me. And mind you, I was never the type to pick with nobody.  
So even though my dad, my dad raised us, he made me feel like we had it all. We was, maybe I  
felt like I was upper middle class, but really I was below the poverty level. That's how he had life  
for us.  
So I got picked on at school. Um, I didn't have the designer. I didn't have, you know, my hair  
done in the latest style.  
My grandmama did our hair or she couldn't do hair. Um, we wore Walmart clothes and we only  
got one set of clothes for the entire school year. So if I got a stain on my shirt, that stain will  
always be there.  
My daddy didn't buy that, you know, shop. He never did come out with that powder, washing  
detergent. It didn't come out.  
So I just got picked on, you know, we just looked at, you know, I just, I, I was just like a walking  
target for people to pick on me. And I wasn't the type that, you know, put my head down, um,  
let people say what they had to say, turn the other cheek. I wasn't the girl for that or whatever.  
And so, you know, we were in the cafeteria is the girl was, you know, picking on me. And I don't  
think all the rules my daddy had was, he don't care if I got suspended from school, but the P  
the teacher or the principal, but they not say I hit first. So I couldn't show nobody first.  
So this girl hit me. So we fight first, first class for the day started yet. And they called my daddy  
at work.  
Y'all it wasn't no, you know, maybe PTO sick days. My daddy was a real man. He never called in.  
He was never late. He didn't go home early. He didn't do any of that shit.  
He was a man that went to work like that every single day. And he was at work. So the fact that  
he had to go and talk to his supervisor about having to leave work early, that wasn't up, youknow, he, he wasn't a mate, a mate that kind of man he went to work.  
Um, so it was kind of like, um, for him, I feel like it was like a embarrassment or something like,  
I didn't even get, I just got to work, you know, and I'm already having to, you know, go and talk  
to somebody and tell him, I gotta, you know, leave because you at school fighting me saying a  
third. And so, you know, this new generation, we like, we call a supervisor, ain't coming in. We  
walk right up to him and be like, I'm leaving.  
My daddy wasn't like that. You know, he, he took pride in being able to go to work and provide  
for his family. So my dad had an old truck.  
I want to say it was probably was like in the eighties or seventies. He had an old Chevy truck  
and he, if you didn't slam the door, it would just jiggle. So it, his damn truck door was going to  
come open.  
So yelling at me, like swearing, like he was mad as hell. And I mean, like, damn, you told me as  
long as, you know, as long as I don't hit nobody first, I'm good. But this girl hit me.  
So now this particular day, this part of the day, I was supposed to just let somebody hit me. And  
then I'll just go tell the teacher, you told me I didn't have to go tell no teacher. Somebody could  
put that in.  
So now at this point, I'm just full of emotion because my daddy mad. And I'm just like, this  
motherfucker about to kill me. I'm like, I'm about to go.  
So my dad pulled up in his credit union, swung that damn old truck door just to rock it. I said,  
yeah, when he parked this goddamn truck, I'm getting the fuck up out of here. Cause he trying  
to kill me.  
That's when my car went because he was sweating and didn't drive over 30 miles per hour. This  
day you're going 60\. I'm getting the fuck up out this truck.  
So we pulled up at the credit union. When he go, time that door swung when I know he got in  
there. I got out that truck.  
And I was gone because I just thought he was going to kill me. So I'm at this point, I'm a  
runaway. That's who he did.  
This is not the man that I know. This is not what he told me to do. I'm not about to die.  
I'm gone. Let's let's, let's look at it from his perspective for just a moment. Okay.  
He has to provide for three kids. His only way to provide for these kids is through his job. So  
your actions, which were in essence, a reaction not only caused him to miss work, it caused him  
to miss money.So in his eyes, cause now that I'm older, like I saw a bunch of stuff growing up with an alcoholic  
dad. Now that I was older, I had, I went back and I started looking at the why behind some of  
the actions that I saw between him, my mom. And it was on my journey of forgiveness, basically  
forgiving them for different things, which ultimately was releasing me from the prison in my  
own heart of holding on to grudges that meant nothing.  
And we're only affecting me at this point. So looking at it from issues, what do we're about a  
size seven? You said he's five. I'm joking.  
He missed his daughter's in trouble again. He just got to work a job that you said he was  
extremely dedicated to. And now he has to break that dedication and he has to go and explain  
to another man why he has to break that dedication.  
So he's driving here, not only thinking about the fact that his daughter has caused some type of  
issue, but now his check ain't going to be full. Because if you, if, if, if you have parents that grew  
up, what is 50, 60, 70s that worked in an environment like that? Y'all know what it means for  
them to say, my check ain't going to be full. Right.  
So now he's having to think about all of this compiling. So that's why he was, you know, when  
we, when we tell these stories now about our lives and things like that, we got to now go back  
and psychologically break it all down to what all was really, really going on in those instances to  
understand the reactions that other people have. Exactly.  
And so there was a lot there that he was going through emotionally as a father of three, a  
single father of three that he's trying to do his best to provide for. And now my daughter's  
causing me some shit that I have to go deal with on top of whatever he was already dealing  
with mentally behind his own transgressions and things that he was going through guys.  
Sometimes let me tell you guys something that's, that's on here.  
Okay. Our parents were doing the best they could with what they knew and what they had. And  
sometimes it's hard to swallow that.  
And you know, even with some of us went through some hell. Okay. Don't let that stop you  
from reaching the altitude that you're supposed to reach.  
Don't let that stop you from your purpose. And at this point in life as an adult, if you are still  
holding onto it, I recommend one of two things, go talk to a professional about it or forgive  
them. Because during those times your parents were doing what they knew and what they  
could as best as they possibly could.  
And it took a long time cause me and my mom had her some rough, rough times, rough times,  
but back to you, net. Okay. So I hit, I left, I had a cell phone, my grandmother, which is his mom,  
stay maybe about 10 minutes from the bank.  
And then I had a cousin that stayed maybe like 12 minutes from the bank. I knew Brandon wasgoing to tell. So I went to my cousin's house.  
I ran to my cousin's house. I was like, listen, you know, I got in the fight at school. My dad is  
driving real fast.  
He yelling, screaming, cussing me out. I feel like I'm going to die. Cause mind you, my daddy  
did not play.  
I got whoopies. I got whoopies. I didn't get abused.  
Well, you know, this, that, as they call it abuse. But my daddy took off his belt. He never hit me  
with his hands one time.  
But before then, I just got a whooping with a belt by my daddy. And so, you know, I didn't want  
no whooping or whatever. So, and I feel like I wasn't deserving because I did what he told me to  
do.  
Somebody put their hands on me. I hit him back. So I went to my cousin's house.  
I stayed there for a few hours. Um, you know, word went around and then, you know, it's  
missing. And so they started calling her phone and she was like, man, I can't hold you.  
I'm going to have to tell him for she to get, tell him out her mouth. I'm hitting her though.  
Cause I'm gone.  
So I'm just running, you know? So, um, I'm just going to various people's house. Then I ended  
up in a field like an empty field. And so again, I had a cell phone.  
So I was texting this guy that I was telling myself, my calling myself liking or calling him my  
boyfriend. We probably had talked in maybe a year. Uh, I even reached out to my oldest  
brother when my daddy, when, when my mama died, he ended up going to Tennessee.  
So I'm texting him. I'm laying my sister, twin calling my brother, calling answering. They called  
him a good, they was the good children.  
So I was like, nah, y'all gonna tell, you know, y'all gonna tell daddy. Y'all scared of daddy. Y'all  
gonna say, so I'm not answering they call.  
So I'm new. I'm in a field. It's dark.  
It's late. I text this guy. I was like that.  
I was calling myself liking. And I ran away. It's dark.  
Mosquitoes eat me up. What you do? He say, I can sneak you through my bedroom window.  
This was about an hour and a half walk to his house.Like I'm on my way. If it's fine, it's probably like seven 30, eight o'clock right before dark. I just  
did.  
Um, I walked to his house and I'll text him. I'm like, I'm outside. He let me come to his bedroom  
window.  
Mind you, when I'm at his house, I'm not thinking of anything like, okay, we're going to have  
sex. And then I'm just thinking, you know, I get out the damn nighttime, you know what I'm  
saying? Mosquitoes eat me up. Cause I'm a tomboy at this point.  
I'm like, you know, I'm not thinking that they're going to go down. I'm just like, I didn't need a  
place to chill at real quick. So he let me through the bedroom window.  
He goes to his living room. I'm under his bed on my cell phone. Just texting my friends.  
Nothing, nothing unusual. Just out the field rather. After his, you know, his house settle down,  
his parents go to sleep.  
He come back in the room and he was like, you know, basically was I going to do something?  
And so in my mind, I'm like, well, you know, I felt obligated because I'm at his house. He  
keeping me from being outside. So let me just go for it.  
So if he get in a position, I'm a virgin. And then I was like, you know, it started and like, it was  
hurt. So I'm like, now, you know, forget it.  
I'm a go. So he back up off of me. Um, I told him, I had to tell him no like twice.  
Cause you know, what? I'm like, okay, no, I'm not going to do this. Um, I'm just going to leave or  
whatever. So he got up off of me and I left five months later.  
Let's just say four months later. Um, I had started my cycle when I was 14\. So when me being  
off of my cycle, I'm like, shit, I didn't want to deal with that.  
No way. My mind, I didn't grow up with a mother. So missing a cycle, it wasn't like, Oh, you  
pregnant.  
Oh, it's like, thank you. I'm riding my bike, riding my skates. I'm in bed camp.  
You know, I'm just living, living my teenage life. But I ended up going back home the next day  
because my sister texted me. She said, dad said, you gonna get hungry.  
You'll come back home. So then I got hungry. So I was only the next day I walked through the  
door and I was like, nothing happened.  
My daddy ain't say nothing to me. I walked in the house. I'm like, okay, you know, I'm going to  
have to get his shit.He didn't say nothing. He just let me come on back home and like ain't nothing happened. And I  
was hungry for sure.  
Matter of fact, when I left this guy's house, my daddy, uh, he left his truck door unlocked. So I  
walked all the way back home, hour and a half walk on the phone, my oldest brother, let him  
know what I was going on. Staying on the phone with me.  
Um, so I made it to my daddy's truck. He had one of those old school trucks. So, you know, it  
was just like one seat.  
It was a long seat. So I slept on my daddy's truck that night, had my alarm set. I knew my  
daddy, um, got up for work.  
I knew what time his alarm went off. So I made sure about an hour before his alarm went off,  
my alarm was going off. And so my alarm went off.  
I got out of his truck and I went to, uh, the backyard. Okay. And so I stayed in the backyard.  
So my daddy went, got up, went to work. I heard his truck going off. And, um, when he drove  
off, I went in the house, took me a bath, got on the bus and went to school in the morning.  
I went to school, got out of school, walked in the house, like ain't nothing happened. And so,  
um, it, like I said, I was in bed camp. Uh, you know, bed camp costs the money.  
So during that summer, I was more aggressed trying to, uh, with my guy that he had a lawn  
care company. I'm more aggressed during the summer trying to raise up money to pay for my,  
uh, bed camp, get to bed camp. Right before I get to bed camp, my aunties knew, no, no, no.  
I went to bed camp. Okay. Uh, but my cycle was off.  
So I didn't have no cycle, but I'm not knowing what's going on. Not thinking anything of it.  
Yeah.  
Right. And then, uh, I ended up going to bed camp one day, we outside in the summer heat and  
I just felt dizzy. I felt nauseated.  
And I was like, and then my instructor, she was a bitch. So I was like, you know, I'm not dealing  
with this. Called my dad and said, daddy, can you pick me up? I don't want to do this.  
After he was playing a note on my clarinet. He ain't take too much time of that. But I was like,  
I'm not doing it.  
So, um, so the rest of the summer, I'm just visiting my people on my mama's side. And so one  
of them, so I, you know, I was gaining weight a little bit and my pants weren't buttoned. And so  
now at this point, walking around with my pants unbuttoned because they couldn't button up  
or whatever.And I'm going to tell my daddy to buy me no new clothes. I was just going to wait till school  
starts, you know, I was waiting for clothes. And so I go to my cousin's house and I go to my  
auntie's house and she said, Nat, you look like you're pregnant.  
And I'm just like, you know, bro, don't, don't come at me like that. I just felt like that was like  
messy people. They are.  
And so I was like, you know, he'd go another store for y'all to tell. So I'm just like, I'm not  
pregnant or whatever. They said my nose was spreading.  
I'm like, how your nose spreading? I don't know if y'all talk about that. Let me see if they get to  
talk about everything spreading when you're pregnant. I'm like, my nose not spreading.  
And so, um, she said, well, Nat, if I buy a pregnancy test, would you take it? Sure. You know, just  
to check y'all up. She got a $30, but a dollar pregnancy test.  
Don't sleep. Don't sleep on them. Had me peeing this cup, the cup that come with the  
pregnancy test.  
She said, pee here. I poured it out, did the pregnancy test and it said, you're pregnant. I told my  
agent, I said, well, you went about a dollar pregnancy test.  
Like, so now at this point, you know, I'm insulting her, you know, right. You bought a dollar  
pregnancy test. Like, and it ain't that, you know what I'm saying? 99%.  
You know, I'm just, you know, talking to her, like she real stupid. And you trying to figure out a  
way to get out of it. No, I'm not knowing if I'm pregnant.  
No, no, no. I'm saying, yeah, you know, that's what I'm saying. Like you, you psyched yourself  
out to where like, it ain't happening.  
That ain't true. That ain't it. Whatever.  
So I'm like, okay, a real pregnancy test. So she go with, uh, get this pregnancy test when you  
got to pee on a stick. And I'm like, okay, that's more like it.  
Like, you know what I'm saying? She come up in here with this cheap ass pregnancy test. Of  
course it's going to say five. I pee on the stick, it say positive.  
She say, but I'm still naive and everything. So I don't know what the two lines or the one line  
mean. I just do it to her.  
You tell me what he say. She say positive. I said, well, I don't know what to tell you because I  
ain't never did nothing.  
So, you know, not worried about nothing, not worried about nothing. So her and my other little  
relatives, they start chit chatting like little fucking birds. And it was like, man, there's a, uh, itwas in North Hills in Marina, Mississippi.  
It was called the Center for Pregnancy Women. And, um, there was like, well, you know, do you,  
can we take you here? So I'm like, all right, whatever. So we go to the, to this nonprofit  
organization downtown, uh, North Hills and you know, the little ladies come in and talk to me.  
And you know, they done told I don't pass. I'm not two tests or five. I was pregnant and I'm still  
a ninet or whatever.  
So they asked me, could I give me a pregnancy test? So I'm like, sure. You know, I'm like, okay,  
this is going to be accurate. Cause they went and got the dollar store.  
So let it go with, you know, tell me to pee again in the club, come back out. And of course it says  
that I'm pregnant. So at this point I'm just like, okay, okay.  
You know, so reality is setting in. Yeah. Like what's going on.  
And so the lady was like, you know, say that you're pregnant or whatever. I said, well, you know,  
I'm not pregnant. I'm like, I'm still not pregnant because I never done anything.  
That's the point. I'm trying to get them to understand. I've never been penetrated.  
So I'm not pregnant. And she was like, well, have you ever been around someone? And they  
was, you know, you was about to when you stopped and she was like, because sperm swim, so  
you don't have to actually be penetrated to get pregnant. So that's when I'm like, Oh shit,  
because that's exactly what happened.  
I have, I was still a virgin. He did not go inside of me. I told him to stop.  
I was in a clear, but Jesus, Lynette and Joseph. Yes. So when she said that, what she was like,  
sperm swim, she said if anybody placed it in that area and they had precom, you could have  
possibly got pregnant out of precom.  
She was like, has this ever happened to you? So now I'm like, I'm crying because that happened.  
So I said, no, that never happened to me. I'm like, yeah.  
When I ran away from home, we've been to, I told him to stop, but I'm like, damn, you know,  
how, how did I, how did this happen to me? Like, how did, you know, precom get me pregnant?  
And so I'm still saying now five months pregnant saying now, so she was like, she made a few  
calls. She said, well, I'm able to get you in for ultrasound today. Um, do you mind going for  
ultrasound? I'm like, sure.  
But now at this point, my balloon is deflated because I know that this one incident happened.  
And now that I know precom, uh oh, and now can you hear, you hear Donna? Now that I know  
precom is a thing, baby, it might be possible. And she was like, you're five months pregnant.You don't ever feel anything in your stomach. Donna, I thought it would get you. Now I'm going  
to feel something in my stomach.  
Yeah. You'll be feeling something in my stomach, but I'm not knowing that it's a baby kicking in  
my stomach at five months. I'm just thinking whatever.  
So we go to get an ultrasound. So I'm, I'm baby I'm like a damn long tail cat in a room full of  
rocket shells. I'm just nervous.  
Like they don't put this gel on me. They don't put this goddamn thing up to my stomach. And all  
I hear is a damn heartbeat.  
So at this point I'm crying. I'm crying. Right.  
My daddy had always told me and my sister, cause his, his siblings had children, his siblings  
kids had children. And, um, he always told us y'all ain't finna bring no baby up in my house. And  
this and this and that.  
So again, I was a girl that is like, you know, whatever daddy said, that was it. So I'm not bringing  
no children in my house. So now, you know, I'm in this situation.  
That's why I'm like, no, y'all get up off of me because this ain't that. Right. Were you, was it  
more fear at that point that you had more than anything or or the thought of potentially  
disappointing your father who you looked at with such high regard? Everything.  
Fear. Disappointment. Run me through the emotions here.  
So I'm laying on the bed and when I, cause I can hear the heartbeat. So I'm just immediately  
start crying. My sister in the waiting room because she sided with me, you know, she ain't  
pregnant or whatever.  
So she sided with me or whatever. And so when the, so one of my aunties, me and her don't  
talk to my boy. Um, she in the room, I think one of my cousins in a room.  
And so when they said, do you want to know what you handed? I just started crying because I  
knew that I could not take, I couldn't tell my dad that I was his girl pregnant. Like I'm just 15  
years old. Right.  
14, 14\. I'm just 14 years old and I'm pregnant. Like these are the girls that my dad talk about.  
These fast ass little girls. I'm no fast ass little girl. I'm no talking boy.  
This ain't, I don't fall in that category. I'm raised like that. I'm not fast.  
So I'm just hearing the heartbeat. I'm just in a daze. The lady said, do you want to know what  
you had? My auntie say, yeah, tell her what it is.I'm like the lady, like, well, she has to say. So I said, yeah. And she was like, you having a little  
girl.  
So now, you know, I'm, you know, I'm not excited. I don't know what my options are. Um, can't  
go again.  
Can't go back home. So now I'm like, what? You know, what am I going to do? So my cousin  
takes me to her house and so I'm depressed. I'm crying.  
I'm saying that this, when you switch days, we on the same day. Okay. So I'm like, you know, I  
don't been more aggressive all week.  
You know, all summer, I got like 200 some dollars saved for baby care. I said, well, if you go, can  
you just take me home so I can get my money and not come back to your house? My cousin at  
this point, she had her twenties or whatever. And so she was like, okay, before this happened,  
my day didn't work.  
You know, before I could even, I'm thinking of a master plan because you know, I'm 14 years  
old. I think I got it all planned. You know, you know everything.  
Well, I'm feeling rough on this man. I hear my cousin on the phone. She's talking like, you know,  
you know, them two, two, two response words and shit.  
Because what is she talking about? I don't know. She was like, you know what? I ain't gonna call  
her name. Why would you do that? And this and this and that.  
And I was just like, what the fuck did she do? So my cousin get off the phone. She tell me, and  
my cousin didn't agree with it. She was like, Nick Charles, no.  
So now at this point I'm crying and I'm just like, why the fuck did she say, you know, I'm trying  
to get my money. I'm thinking about getting my money. I got my whole plan together.  
I can't even get my money. Then I was on my dresser that same day. Right.  
And so I'm telling my cousin, you know, I can't go back. You know, I can't go home. Uh, my  
sister is at home.  
My brother is at home. My sister texted me, you know, my daddy had to leave work again  
because that was like news that he could stay at work for. And so now, you know, school about  
to start in a few months.  
I'm not going home. My, um, AT had told my daddy. So I'm just like, at this point, I'm just like,  
want to give up on life because I knew my dad, you know, that he was doing the best he can  
just to raise three of us.  
And I got pregnant. I don't know how I got pregnant. So everybody asked me after this, theywas like, Lynette you already called me Nick, Nick, you know, who your baby daddy? And I'm not  
telling nobody who my baby daddy is because I'm stuck between, okay.  
I know I didn't have sex. And then I'm like, listen, I'm thinking I'm married. Okay.  
Jesus. I know. That's why I said Jesus, Lynette and Joseph earlier.  
Yeah. At this point, I'm like, I'm married because how in the hell I'm going to tell somebody who  
know we ain't have sex that I'm pregnant about him. Can you imagine his friends? Oh, stay with  
me.  
I know we didn't have sex. He know we didn't have sex. So at this point I know what the lady at  
the clinic told me, but I was like, that ain't happening.  
I'm not saying nothing to nobody. So everybody asked me who he is, who the baby daddy, I'm  
telling them, I don't know. That's my answer to everybody.  
My sister texted me and asked me, she said, you know, Nat, you know, whoop-de-whoop,  
daddy want to know. Um, yeah, it's bullshit. So I confided in my sister.  
I said, Lyn, it's Josh. You know, I tell her what the lady at the clinic said. That's the only person it  
could be.  
Lo and behold, her scary ass at home with daddy. She going to tell my daddy, I can let you tell  
her what happened, you know, in the household during this time. But all I know is my daddy  
know it's Josh.  
I only told my sister. So now I'm trying to understand, your daddy on his way to Josh's house.  
No, no, Hanifah, Lyn did that.  
I just felt betrayed. Cause I'm like, I done told everybody I don't know. I tell my sister who it was  
and my daddy on his way.  
Matter of fact, she had to tell him what he said. Cause he don't know what he say. Lyn, where  
you at? What happened? He knew where Josh stayed because Snoop got a baby with a loaner.  
He want, he didn't go over there. He called on the phone. Well, how did he find out? Oh, I  
definitely told him, but I ain't said no location.  
I ain't want my dad to go to jail. What made you tell him? Cause I was in the house with your  
dad. You just cleared that up.  
Fair enough. Fair enough. So not, not, not Charles on the way.  
Let's not forget Lynette, you're in a shelter somewhere. And me and Snoop had to take the  
route. So yeah, I'm telling you cause you ain't get to take it and we taking it.Well, I would've took it for y'all. So anyway, now this shit going on, you know, my daddy, my  
daddy done talked to his parents and what's the first thing this guy said? That baby ain't mine. I  
ain't never did nothing for him.  
Of course you did. So now, so now I'm having to, you know, deal with the emotions of, is this his  
baby? Am I married? You know, I'm going back and forth. So now I'm just depressed.  
I'm just depressed because whatever, you know, I'm just, all this bullshit happening at once. A  
knock comes to my door. Oh, so I go do prenatal.  
Of course I'm five months pregnant. I'm a teenager. Now the state got their nose and  
everything.  
They asked me who the baby daddy was. I told him who the baby daddy was. I'm 14 at the time.  
He's 16 at the time. I look up somebody knocking at my door. Who knocking at my door? Police  
statutory rape.  
Oh, it was just 16\. I was 14\. He couldn't have sex with anybody under the age of 16, 16 and up.  
Y'all had to be at a 16 and up club. Anything under 16\. I had to be with anybody under 16\.  
The baby, he was 16\. I was 14\. Statutory rape.  
So, um, the police knock at the door, want my daddy to bring me. Oh, before that, my auntie  
say, my daddy want me back at home. I'm like, you out your damn mind.  
He gonna kill me. I'm hell no. So they dragged me to the car, put me in a car.  
We pull up to my daddy's house. I'm crying profusely like, y'all, he's going to kill me because I  
knew all that. He told me, you know, as a child growing up, like, you know, he don't, you know,  
no children.  
So he come open the door and you know, they all like, well Nick, get out the car, get out the car.  
And so he come open the door and he was like, Nick, get out the car. Of course I'm not the one  
to disobey my daddy.  
So I'm like, in my mind, you know, I'm gonna be cast ashore. So I get out the car. Because yeah,  
you motherfuckers brought me over here.  
I'm about to die. Fuck it. So I get out the car.  
My daddy told me to, I walk in the house slowly cause I'm just, you know, waiting on them. I  
just, you know, I walk into my room and I'm just laying in my bed and nothing ever happened.  
So he never said anything.  
By the time he said something to me again, he said, he asked me, was I all right? He asked me,did I need anything? And I was, you know, like, nah, I'm okay. You know, so I was good. I'm like,  
shit, I'm dodged a damn bullet.  
So yeah. Dodged a bullet because he said that his grandchild was not going to be raised with  
them people. Just like he said, he said, y'all last name Russian for a reason.  
And her name going to be a Russian too. I'm not going to have my grandchild being raised by  
them people. And that's why he said he wanted you to come home.  
She got the Becky in there. So I'm good or whatever. So then the police come and I had to go to  
the police station because when I was at the, at the clinic, they asked me a series of questions  
cause I'm a teenage, you know, a teenage pregnancy.  
So I'm not thinking that, you know, they asked me about the age and this and this and that  
because somebody was in trouble. I'm just answering the question. And so they had to submit  
a report, police come, my dad had to take me to the station.  
So now I'm mad. So I'm, you know, at the police station pregnant, they asked me questions  
about him. And so I'm just mad because I'm like, we only two years apart.  
Like why is all this going on? And, um, my dad is like, you know, answer him or whatever,  
whatever. But I never did. I was like, I don't know who my baby daddy is because I just thought  
it was ridiculous.  
But my daddy started talking, he started, he knew. And so I go to school, word travel fast. Now  
I'm being picked on at school saying that Josh raped me.  
Oh, but that's my baby. So now I'm having to deal with, oh, you say he raped you and this and  
that. But cause those people in my school, they're not understanding what standards to a  
rapist.  
They just hear right. He's here. Right.  
And he go along, you know, everybody just, you know, talking and they, they, uh, hollering at  
the bus window at me. So it was like a humiliation. And so, I mean, let's, we got to break this  
down.  
We ain't just skipping over some parts of, cause that is, we're adding on more trauma on top of  
a teen pregnancy on top of everything else, the, the fear, the anxiety, everything that's going  
on here for you. Because even I'm gonna be real with you, Ned, even right now, you know, the  
fact that you've kept your composure together so well throughout the telling of this story leads  
me to believe that there is still something within you that's being blocked or still some trauma  
being blocked. That's not allowing you to fully release certain feelings towards everything.  
And so it's like an egg. You have one hell of a tomboy, hard outer shell. But with that outer shell  
that you have is also a yolky inside that you don't let too, too many people get into to see.And it's a part because your dad hardened you. You had to go through certain things with your  
mom and your grandmother. And so it takes a really special group of people or a person to  
crack that outer shell that you have.  
And even then you're a boiled egg. So it ain't all yolky on the inside, because even if they do  
crack past that shell, they still got another softer shell. Don't just get all yolky at that point.  
They still got another shell that they got to get through to get to the yolk of who you actually  
are. And while you use that as a shield right now, I'm here to let you know, that there's going to  
come a time where if you don't fully get it out. It will be more detrimental than it will be positive  
for you.  
So when I'm sitting here in hot seats with people and uncovering different things and listening  
to the story and listening to I'm paying attention to everything, addiction in your words, your  
tone, the speed at which you're talking, when you speed up and slow down, I'm here to let you  
know that I recognize something. And as great as you are right now at what you're doing in the  
amount of people that you're helping get to their greatness in life, you're also hindering  
yourself a little bit because the way that you're telling portions of this story, let me know that  
there's still trauma within there and it's okay. We all have some, you know, trauma is an  
interesting thing once you actually start to learn the root of it and how it affects some parts of  
your life and how we get in these trauma cycles.  
And that's okay. But because of the love that I have for you and the dopeness of our  
relationship, I'm here to let you know through active listening and we're being honest, open  
and transparent. There's still some things holding you back, whether known or unknown from a  
trauma side of things, because we're talking about real life situations that have broken families  
apart, real life situations that have caused others to break down, whether physically, mentally,  
emotionally, or all three.  
And at this point, you're telling it as if it's a drama and a comedy. And when I hear things like  
that, it lets me know that there's something deeper that's still there that we might not even get  
to pull out tonight. It might be one of these private conversations that you and I have offline.  
Okay. But just know that I'm aware and we'll talk more about it. Okay.  
Keep going. Uh, so I ended up, you know, having to deal with the school saying that I'm saying  
that this guy raped me. He know that, you know, how far everything went when I told him, no,  
he stopped, you know, he never penetrated me.  
So he's a question whether or not, you know, basically I'm trying to put a baby on him and now  
he's having to deal with law enforcement going to juvenile for a rape. So I had to deal with all of  
that, you know, while being pregnant, um, I'm in like my, close to my final trimester and trying  
to catch up on labs, trying to catch up on, um, different visits, um, prenatal vitamins, uh, going  
to parenting classes alone, you know, so now, you know, I'm 15 years old, couldn't have my firstbaby and I'm doing it alone. I mean, as far as like, not my ideal situation.  
So my first, you know, as a child, as a girl, you had your dreams of being married, having your  
children, everything mapped out. And so that wasn't, that was never one of my visions for  
myself to be having a child when I was younger. And so, um, my family on my mom's side, I  
always justified, or I'm not going to say justified, but they put me in a bubble with my mom.  
Then I would say, you know, you just like your mom, mind you, I'm not really knowing who they  
talking about. My mom passed away when I was three years old, but they justified it because  
my mom had my oldest brother when she was 14 years old. Okay.  
And so they tried to always say, Oh, you just like your mama. Your attitude is like your mama.  
Like I just walked my mom's footsteps with this side of the family.  
Um, when it really wasn't the case. And, um, my mom, he and her pregnancy, her entire  
pregnancy, again, she had, I guess, 13 other siblings. Um, and so it was easier for her to hide  
the pregnancy in a two bedroom, two bedroom house, um, with all the people in it.  
And she had my brother, they say in a closet, you know, she kept the whole pregnancy a secret.  
She was a hidden set woman, wore jackets they said, and she just had her pregnancy, hid her  
pregnancy from everybody. My brother was just born at the house, but you know, I always tell  
them, you know, told them that I wasn't my mama, that that wasn't my story.  
That wasn't what I did. You know, I don't know what my mama's story was and she went out  
and has, you know, sex with a man and she was fast and she did all those things cause she, you  
know, wasn't here to tell it. But all they looked at is the, all they looked at it is the, you know, I  
had a teenage pregnancy.  
My mom had a teenage pregnancy and me and her was the same in our story is different. So I  
had to battle with that. Um, and I ended up, you know, the doctors confirmed that I had no  
penetration whenever they would check my cervix, they couldn't check them.  
Uh, it was like they had to call two nurses to hold me down where they checked everything  
because I had never been penetrated. And as a result of that, I had to have a C-section years  
old because I couldn't handle pushing the baby out. Right.  
Ned, do you hear yourself? How many times have you told this story? Everybody don't get the  
story. Um, just people I'm close to, I've told it to them. Well, I've told it to many people because,  
you know, as a teenage pregnant person, you want to protect your image.  
So I had to tell my story just to let them know that I wasn't the girl that was being fast. I wasn't  
out here having sex with various people. This shit just happened to me.  
And I said, no. So I told her to try to protect my image. And I also told him like to let them know  
that this is a thing.Like if you even play around with it, you can potentially get pregnant. So I didn't, I didn't tell a  
lot of people, but like I said, it was just to let them know that I ain't like that. Like I, this, this is  
what happened.  
Um, I ain't fast. I ain't, you know, I ain't even having sex. It was years later before I even had  
sex.  
Okay. So that's why that was mainly why I told the story just to try to protect my image from,  
you know, walking the hallways with this big ass belly, but to have a baby and all my friends  
knew me to be who I was, you know, they ain't like, they ain't like that, you know? So I had some  
of them defending me, but of course you got the teachers, you got the other girls, you know, I  
just fell into this bubble of people who girls that was fast. And that's, that's not who I was.  
Of course, of course, net you are, well, let me ask you this. You know, you had to have a C-  
section at 15 years old, but never had any vaginal penetration whatsoever. What is, what is Josh  
doing at this time? How's he reacting? How's his parents reacting? What's going on on that side  
of, of the, of the Mississippi? So at this point, um, Josh, Josh was in training school.  
He was in at a juvenile and you go to juvenile so many times you have to go to training school.  
He was writing me letters saying that, you know, if the baby is his, this is the name that he  
wants the baby to be. And it's this and that.  
So he was writing me letters while he was in training school. Um, when I had my baby, um, I  
was heavily involved in church. So I had a few ladies from the church, big support from my  
church family, uh, because they knew me.  
And, um, that was all showing up with me. Uh, I had, like I said, I had a lady, she took me to all  
my doctor's appointments, made sure I stayed on top of my prenatal, all my visits. Um, and so I  
had to go, I had to get up at maybe like five o'clock that morning.  
My daddy had to go to work. And so, Oh, my grandmama. So that was another thing.  
Like my grandmama, you know, she was, my grandma was a sweet lady. She didn't judge  
nobody, but I knew that I had, you know, certain expectations. She had certain expectations  
from her granddaughters.  
Um, cause she helped, you know, raise and instill things, morals, values into us. And so, you  
know, it was like, I knew that when my grandmama found, found out it wasn't going to be, you  
know, she, her shaming me, it wasn't going to be her, you know, belittling me, making me feel  
bad. But I just felt like, you know, I'd let my grandmama down.  
It was a disappointment. Yeah. Yeah.  
So, um, once she found out she called and there was a phone call I was trying to avoid or  
whatever. So it was like my grandmama, I mean my daddy, then my grandmama, everybodyelse, I didn't care, you know, whatever. But my grandmama called and she, you know, asked to  
speak to me.  
And so I'm on the phone trying to leave, you know, like, I didn't know what it was going to be  
like, but I prepared for the disappointment. I'm preparing for maybe a speech. And maybe, um,  
you know, just disappointed for my grandmama.  
But instead, you know, she was like, um, you know, asked me how, how, how I was feeling. Uh,  
she asked me, did I need anything? Um, just let me, she just let me know that she was there for  
me. Okay.  
So she never judged me. She was just like, what you need? And so I felt like, you know, it was  
like, I was safe. I was safe from my grandmama.  
I was safe from my daddy. So at this point I'm good. Like my dad, my dad, okay.  
My grandmama. Okay. At this point I'm good.  
So I didn't care. Uh, so anyway, I had my baby, had my C-section. Um, so I had to get up at five  
o'clock that morning.  
Members from my church came and picked me up to take me to, um, the hospital. I was kind of  
like a little bothered because I was like, you know, my daddy wasn't going to be in a room with  
me. My grandmama wasn't going to be in a room with me.  
I had to do it by myself. My sister was at school. So I'm leaning on my church members.  
But so I'm just scared. Cause it's like, okay, you know, my cousin had an epidural before she  
was like, I mean, you know, pregnancy, a C-section, she was like, you know, when they put the  
epidural in my baby, he was on burn. It was a hurt.  
So I'm scared. You know, I'm just scared. Cause I was by myself.  
Right. And so, um, they put this epidural in me. Well, before they got to, um, put the epidural in  
me, of course, it was more nurses holding me down or whatever, because my cousin had told  
me that it hurt.  
And it is a big, long needle. Came in to try to keep me still. Cause it was like, if you move, you're  
going to get paralyzed.  
So I, that was like, you know, just breathe and this and that. So I'm listening to them and I'm  
like, okay, you know, I gotta get through it. So I'm taking a deep breath and they did it.  
And it really, really wasn't bad. By far, the whole needle got in. I was already getting numb.  
So I was fine. So I had, um, my daughter, um, it's, you know, I hear her cry and you know, my, at  
this point, my sister come in, uh, different other family members come in. My goddaddy there,um, my daddy's still at work.  
Nobody called him and told him that I had my baby. So of course he upset, because you know,  
his daughter didn't have a baby. He had to go to work.  
Ain't nobody updated him. He nervous. And so, um, my grandmama get, you know, call my dad  
and let him know everything went okay.  
And so he came after, um, I had her, but, you know, so he called and said, you know, they sent  
my daddy on the way. So I'm excited about that. Um, but before my daddy make it there, Josh's  
parents made it first.  
And so they in the room, you know, looking at my daughter and listening or whatever. And so  
when my daddy got there, he walked in the room, realized who was there. He asked me, was I  
okay? I said, I was okay.  
He walked out the door because he didn't want them there. So now I'm dealing with, you know,  
the emotions of what is this about? Is life going to be like, you know, he don't want them  
involved. He don't want to, you know, I have to do this without him.  
So now I'm not in a good mood. I was excited that, you know, his parents showed up cause he  
was in juvenile, but then my daddy not liking that. So now, you know, I'm just kind of deflated.  
Um, my god daddy, he was a supporter from the jump. Um, they had me on a restriction from  
eating certain foods. You know, you get in the hospital, you gotta be on liquid diets.  
I told my god that I would want to be a Big Mac combo with a Powerade and he brought my Big  
Mac combo up there with a Powerade and he, you know, snacks, had my little hospital  
refrigerator loaded up. The night I had my baby, all my girls came, they spent the night with  
me. So it wasn't too bad.  
Um, it was, it was cool. Like my God had set us straight. We've been having sleepover.  
So we had to sleepover. So I get home. My grandmama had to came there, made up my bed,  
had everything ready, my room clean.  
So, uh, she was just like the mother. I didn't have my dad's grandmama. So, um, I had a, I had a,  
I had a good support group.  
My baby shower, had everything. Everybody brought everything to me and my daughter. Um, it  
was bad at first, but then everybody around me, you know, embraced me and made it all right.  
My daddy asked me, you know, did I plan on finishing school? I'm just like, what kind of  
question is that? You know, my daddy told us we had to graduate high school. So, and I'm  
thinking to myself, do I got another option? What, you know, did things change? Cause I'm still  
in a mindset of, you know, I gotta go to school. I gotta get my education.I gotta get my degree. And then you talking about asking me what, you know, what my plans  
are. But my response was, yeah, I'm going to school.  
I mean, I'm gonna finish or whatever. And I guarantee, I kid you not. Um, I was a CB student  
because not because I wasn't smart.  
It was because I didn't care about school. Um, I didn't do my homework. I didn't study.  
Me and my sister were twins. So anything that was major going on, she had to let me know. We  
was in some of the same classes.  
I was like, Lynn, let me see your homework. I just copied all her stuff. So I wasn't the school girl.  
I wasn't at all. But when I was pregnant with my daughter, that was the first year I made honor  
roll. All year, every, both semesters I made honor roll.  
And, um, my daddy was like shocked, you know, like, cause he wasn't, my daddy just had to sit,  
you know, before I had my daughter he had to sit me down and just tell me, you know, I don't  
care what you do. You just better not fail this grade. You better, you better get this grade.  
So that was my bar. My bar was as long as I can get to the next grade. Cause daddy said, he  
won't put me through no another grade, you know, the same grade over and over.  
I just had to get to the next grade. That was my stamp. And so when I got, uh, you know, I was  
pregnant, I couldn't ride my bike no more.  
My friends, some of my friends didn't talk to me no more. So all I had to do was focus on my  
education. I ain't had nothing to do.  
I'm reading, I'm doing all my homework assignments and I'm just straight A's. I was in the ninth  
grade. I was in ninth grade.  
And so, uh, you know, I want to, I want to pause you there for a second because we skipped  
over something that I wanted to make a point on because a lot of us, do this, what I'm about to  
say. So this whole time that you're going through these things, you have an aura of anxiety just  
over you. How are they going to treat me? How are they going to feel in your mind based on  
previous experiences? Is you're expecting the worst.  
Okay. You're expecting the worst because history has a tendency to repeat itself. Guys, girls,  
women, sorry, no girls on here.  
Women. We do this often in our own lives. We live in anxiety instead of anticipation.  
Okay. And anxiety tells us that the worst is going to happen. And the reason that we live so  
much in anxiety instead of anticipation is because of typical track records.  
We're not accustomed to the best outcome happening for us. We have more experience withbad happening than we have with good. And so we live our lives in a way that doesn't allow us  
to live in anticipation.  
And the difference between anticipation and anxiety is with anxiety, you're expecting the worst  
to happen with anticipation. You're expecting the best to happen. You're looking and searching  
always for the best outcome.  
And that is what you are expecting. That's why when you're anticipating something good  
happen, how do you feel before payday? You feel great. Why? Because you're anticipating  
money coming in.  
How do you feel before Monday? Anxious. You got to go back to work. You got to go and do  
certain things that you don't want to do.  
So a lot of this stuff that you hear that describing on here is the balance between learning how  
to live in anticipation rather than learning how to live in anxiety. And there are a lot of health  
benefits that come to you when you start to live life with anticipation instead of living life in  
anxiety. Expect greatness.  
As all this stuff around us, life as we know it, this is, this is, this is not real. It's not real. And the  
reason that I say it's not real is because two people can experience the same thing or see the  
same thing and have two different experiences.  
And if you recognize that, so like in one of my houses, there's a tree in the backyard that needs  
to be cut down. I never looked at it like that. One of my new guys that just moved in, he used to  
own a landscaping company.  
As soon as he got to the backyard, he was like, we're looking at the backyard, looking at the  
landscape of it and stuff. And he's like, that's a dead tree that needs to be cut down. I said,  
what? He was like, yeah, man, that tree's dead.  
You need to cut that tree down. I was like, I never even looked at that tree like that. And so that  
just let me know off top that two people can be looking at the same thing and see two different  
things.  
And that let me, that allowed me to realize that our perception really does create our reality. If  
we know that our perception creates our reality, then it's on us to allow our perception to  
expect the greatest thing possible for us to continuously happen and live life in anticipation  
rather than living life in anxiety and expect the worst. Go ahead, Nat.  
That's so, um, so every, let me bring you back. My bad. Your dad is now your maternal  
grandmother or great grandmother has told you that everything is all right.  
So you're feeling the love from your family and you're making good grades and you'd have  
made the honor roll because your friends had left you. Some of them anyway, weren't talkingto you anymore. And I have a feeling that that was their parents during that time, letting them  
know, calling you certain names at the house probably saying don't be around that girl  
anymore.  
She's a bad influence. You know how people can be from time to time whenever we want to get  
a story across. And so you make the honor roll.  
You still here, Nat? Yeah. You hear me? I can hear you. Okay.  
Um, you remember that little secret I told you one time when we was on zoom? Yep. Okay.  
Then what going on? All right.  
So hold on one minute. I got you. Yeah.  
Well, I feel like I'm pause. I just want my sister to know that I love her. I'm proud of her for  
telling her story.  
And it is now 41\. You got a whole lot of ball to go, but if you had to do a part two, that's fine or  
whatever, but keep your head up, stay strong throughout, um, your story. So you can get, you  
know, your audience, you can make them aware of your life and your story.  
And again, I'm rooting for you. I love you. And you know, yeah.  
Do what you got to do. Me and Toya, we get Toya on here too now. If you want the first born on  
here to say, mama, go ahead.  
Now I get that to happen, make that happen for you. But yeah, take a deep breath and keep  
going. We love you, Nanny.  
Thank you. All right, y'all. So if y'all can see the whole lifestyle, so I mean like I'm having to use  
the flashlight to store time with his weather.  
Um, so, um, the next episode after, uh, I had my daughter, um, you know, I bring her home.  
Her dad is in training school. Um, her dad is in training school and you know, she, she's, she's  
papa goo like that.  
Right. My daddy, uh, this is granddaughter, his first grandchild. He was in hog heaven.  
Um, and so I kind of had a pretty normal life with, uh, my daughter. My dad was very  
supportive. He paid for my daycare.  
There was a point in time where there was some friction when, um, my children's, uh, daddy,  
not children's my daughter's dad went to the military and got kicked out of military for  
dishonorable discharge. And, um, he was writing me letters while he was in the military. My dad  
was intercepting the letters and you know, it was a little, little drama there, but not too, too  
bad.Um, so the next event happened in my life was me going to juvenile for the second time. Wow.  
So at this point I have a one year old daughter.  
Um, I'm 17 years old and I'm a, I'm in, um, juvenile again, for aggravated assault with a deadly  
weapon for the second time. Well, at least you consistent. Right.  
And so, um, with this, um, my, um, my, my daughter's dad, girlfriend was getting in the midst of  
me and his business. Um, I, at this point I had already moved on dating a guy. Um, I'm headed  
back to my office y'all cause I left my cook.  
So at this point I'm dating a guy and he was, you know, fulfilling what I needed in a boyfriend at  
the time. So I wasn't really worried about my children's father, but my children, I'm so used to  
saying my children's fathers now because, uh, my, my son's dad look after my daughter for me.  
And so, um, at this time, his girlfriend is saying that the baby's not healed.  
Uh, we need to get a DNA test. You know, she's just getting in the midst of our business. And so  
it made me extremely upset because, you know, I just didn't do the drama.  
So I had in my mind, I said, I'm a fuck up. This pretty much what it was. I said, I'm going to fuck  
her up.  
So when I get out of school, we had been arguing back and forth at this time. It was my space.  
And, uh, I was, I was a senior.  
I was a senior. Yeah. Yeah.  
I was a senior in high school and they had already graduated. So I was like, she told me, she  
said, when I get off the bus, I'm going to be at your house. And she gonna, you know, she told  
me what she was going to do to me.  
I told her to just save her time. When I get off the bus, I'll come to her. Cause I was like, you're  
not coming to my daddy house with that drama.  
So as soon as my daddy pulled up, I got in his car. Um, of course, you know, like I said, I mowed  
the grass. I mowed the grass at my daddy house.  
Um, I know how to use tools. I know how to use a lawn mower, weed eater. So I'm, you know,  
I'm, I'm, I'm ready.  
So when I get home, I go, I go into the basement and I get the gas can. And, um, I go in the  
house, I get some bleach, put the bleach in the gas can. And on my way to her, I stopped at the  
gas station and fill the rest of the can up with gas.  
Oh, my left eye. What is story going? Yeah. Yeah.  
So I got my lighter and, um, so I'm in my daddy, my daddy car. So in his car, he got all his toolsin the bay. And so there was a, um, device in his car where you could stick this needle inside of  
like a wire and see if it was live and it was so red that it had fire.  
So I had this, this little device too. Um, all I knew was about, you know, my daddy used to say to  
check if he got some got fire or whatever, but he had a pointy end on his head. That's cool.  
And I had my gas can and I had my lighter. And I was like, uh, call my home girls up. I was like,  
you know, I'm going to go fight.  
And usually, um, whenever I would go fight, I would always take my home girls with me. Cause  
yeah, you know, I didn't want to get jumped anymore. My sister was there too.  
Um, so I got myself, I'm ready. I got, Oh, back then it was a gas station called self co and they  
had these big 64 ounce cups that we could get, uh, to fill up. And so when I got to, I went and  
grabbed one of those cups, I got the gas, I pulled my concoction into my self co cup.  
So, you know, I done went to her house. So now her aunties, cousins, they had a big family. I  
might add, they're all outside, you know, gathering around is like a circle.  
So I had this big 64 ounce cup in my hand, you know, just holding it. Um, you know, let me  
know if they let her bump her gum and her family like, you know, um, hit her, you know, telling  
them to hit, hit me. Uh, but she done came to your house so that, you know, they having to, you  
know, gas her up.  
So as she walked towards me, I had my cup. So I pulled it back and I dashed her with the cup.  
And then I ended up hitting her so hard to where it bust her eye open because of the rim of the  
cup.  
It was a plastic cup. And so, um, now we fight. Now we slide on the gas.  
We fight. I'm telling my friends to hand me the lighter, like give me the lighter. My friends was  
like, it was one, one girl in particular.  
She was like, you gotta, you gotta just fight, just fight. At this point, you know, I'm mad cause  
she not handing me the lighter because I'm like, you know, I want to burn this bitch up. But  
thank God she never handed me the lighter.  
So now I'm just fighting her. Um, they started jumping me. My sister is there.  
She and her car, my daughter in the backseat, my sister, you know, instead of her, I mean she  
just pretty much got in the car cause the other friends I brought with me, they didn't, they  
didn't jump in. Um, so my sister got in her car and start driving towards the both of us. Like she  
finna run us over.  
And so, um, when that happened, the girls, you know, she jumped up, I jumped in my car. Well,  
before I jumped in my car, I threw the cup in my sister's car, because of course she drive up soclose to us to where her car was closer to me. So I threw the cup that I had in my sister's car  
and I jumped in my car and we all drive out.  
Um, of course I go home, I tell my dad I got in a fight. That's all I told him. I didn't tell him  
everything that I did.  
I just told him I got in a fight. And so I was at school the next day and, um, the principal come  
over to intercom and say to my teacher, to send the net Russian to the office for checkout done.  
One thing I knew my daddy was not checking me out of school.  
That man at work. Maybe check out. I said, no, I take my phone because I had a phone, you  
know, I had a phone, right? I said, these motherfuckers done Chris charges on me.  
So instead of me going to the office, but it was like Ross college. It was like a, uh, it was like a,  
uh, school where you picked up skills. Like they had like, I don't mechanic, like mechanic and  
teacher daycare.  
And so I was at that little school, trade school. So they had exit doors, of course, around the  
campus. So I was like, I got my boot bag out, uh, hit the door.  
I took off. I started running through a field by this time. So I was dating a guy.  
Oh, he was much older or whatever. And I let him know that the police was at the school to  
come get me and ask me XTM. Cause he, I told him where I was.  
Can you pick me up? And, um, get me out of dodge. So he told me what a meeting him in. I got  
in the car.  
Um, and so I was gone with him. And so, uh, a few hours later, I want to say either my sister or  
my daddy was calling me. And, uh, basically the police had made it to my house and they told  
my daddy to get me to the police station.  
It will always meet you. Yeah. Yeah.  
They told, they told me to get to the police station, but like I said, my daddy had already knew  
that I had gotten in a fight the day before, but he didn't know, you know, what was the severity  
of it. Right. Yeah.  
So he, you know, told me, you know, he had to take me to the police station and, um, they  
ended up locking me up when, when we got there. And so again, like I told you, uh, the prisons,  
I mean the juvenile in Mississippi, they have court on Tuesdays and Thursdays and Thursdays.  
So this time it was Wednesday.  
So you had to, so you had another night, you had to spend the night. Yeah. I had another night.  
But what I did know was that, uh, shortly after my daddy took me down there, they asked himto go back and get my sister. Okay. And so I even brought Lynn into it.  
I'm sorry. Yeah. They told him to go back and get her.  
Um, so now we both get aggravated assault with a deadly weapon because they said that she  
was trying to run them over with the car. So now I'm in juvenile already. I didn't know they went  
and told my daddy to go get my sister.  
I just, I'm in my cell. I'm already knowing that. Okay.  
Shit. It's Wednesday. I got court in the morning.  
Don't I? First time I ain't shit. This time ain't shit until because I'm not understanding what I did.  
Still.  
I'm not understanding that. I just put gas in the, I am standing there. I'm just like, I see this on  
TV all the time.  
I'm about to light this motherfucker up. I think all of us would like to know the Charles, make it  
to work on Thursday or the Charles have to call in. He didn't, he didn't make it to work.  
He didn't make it to where I didn't think Charles, he was so surprised at the charge in the  
statements to where when he, when they told him what I did and I can look on the, look on his  
face, I knew that I had done messed up. So when he asked me, did I do it? I told him no. When  
the police asked me to, you know, read out everything.  
I said, no, I said I denied everything because I was able to get away. But my sister, I believe my  
sister got pulled over and they said that they smell gas. I want to say, they said that she, uh,  
smell gas, they smell gas.  
And my sister said that she just had once, you know, put gas in the car, but they never was able  
to get the cook because they never had any, anything other than, uh, what they said. And then  
when the girl went to the hospital, cause she had to get stitches across her eye that, you know,  
the medical people said that she had, you know, the gas smell on her. It was just circumstantial  
evidence.  
And you're 17 at this time, right? I'm 17\. Hmm. So you want to be on that border? Straight on it.  
Of it being a juvenile charge or an adult charge. And so, um, I'm doing good. You know, I'm like,  
you know, I did this before, baby.  
When I seen my sister walking through that door with handcuffs on, that just broke me down  
because my super, you know, my sister was like the girl that was in afterschool programs. Like  
she was like student council. She wasn't, she wasn't built for this.  
I was that girl that she wasn't getting into no fights. Really? Anybody mess with my sister, theygot to mess with me. So when I seen my sister come in and she was crying, I'm telling her, but  
the thing about it is me and my sister knew sign language.  
So our sales, we can see each other. So we doing sign language back and forth to each other.  
And I'm telling her like, don't cry, you know, like don't cry or whatever.  
So we just talking back and forth. Um, we get to a court the next morning. Oh, look at that  
lights.  
And then that was last. So, um, we get to court the next morning. My daddy, uh, my dad, my  
daddy was there.  
What boots to say? Somebody go to court. I mean, somebody go to jail. The whole family come  
to court.  
We had to line up. And so, uh, they had me in shackles. They had me in handcuffs.  
They had the shackles connected to the handcuffs. And my daddy saw me and he told the  
judge, you know, he was like, y'all don't have to do her like that. She, you know, she basically,  
you know, he, my daughter ain't did all that.  
I did it. But he didn't want to see me like that. But of course I said, I'm being hard because I'm  
like, you know, you can't cry.  
You know, you can't cry in jail. You can't cry in front of these judges. You can't make them feel  
like you, you know, they breaking you down.  
So I'm just being hard or whatever. And so, um, I told the judge told me, he said, um, that he  
was going to have to talk to the prosecutors because they would sit and get ready and certify  
me as an adult. Yep.  
And I was looking at 20 years. And I just heard, I turned back and looked at my daddy. His head  
was already down like this.  
He was just, his, his head was down. My daddy and his, um, at this time he in his late fifties.  
Okay.  
Uh, so that, that, that, that broke me down. That made me cry. What he said, the judge said,  
didn't make me cry, but seeing my daddy with his head down, uh, broke me down.  
So, um, um, they ended up releasing me. How many people we got on this line right now? 237\.  
Go, go, go on commercial real quick.  
All right. Well, let's take a small break right here, guys. Hello.  
Kids had to go put up, put his baby to sleep. It's evening. There we go.Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.  
My apologies. He said we went on kind of long. It was getting good.  
Ladies and gentlemen, the wonderful step-by-step day by day home and community based  
services. Queen miss Evie. Hey everyone.  
I'm Evie. Um, those of you who don't know me, uh, my background is in home and community  
based services, which is basically, uh, what funds state contracts in all 50 States. Um, in most  
States you have to be certified as a home and community based provider and you have to have  
the house licensed.  
Not all States are like that. Um, most are in Texas. You don't have to have the house license.  
Um, before I begin, I just want to thank net for telling her story. One thing I've noticed with  
people in our industry and people who are successful in general, um, there's always some type  
of background to where they never give up. Right.  
So, um, I know like net story and, um, watching her grow from when we first started off, uh,  
years ago to seeing us now, it's, it's awesome. So she's, she's the main reason why I never gave  
up whenever I started, because her and I started around the same time except she did  
unlicensed and I wanted to go more of the certified licensed route. Um, so thanking it for  
everything you do for the group.  
Um, now diving back in into home and community based services. Um, so home and  
community based services is what funds the contracts with the state. So back in the 1980s,  
Congress passed this to fund all the States.  
So I'm actually going to share my screen if I'm able to host disabled attendees screen sharing.  
Darn, I can't share my screen. No worries.  
Net allow everybody to allow her to share that if you, if you're wrapped up. Yeah. If not, no  
worries.  
I had like little, um, um, thing I wanted to show. So Congress basically just passed a $400 billion  
bill nationwide that's going to increased funding for home and community based services. So I  
don't know if y'all seen me marketing for, um, this webinar, how to get state funded through  
unlicensed group homes and unlicensed care homes.  
Amy, try now. Oh, okay. Oh, who's that pretty girl right there? Isn't it? Okay, there we go.  
Okay, here we go. So I always like to watch Congress budget office and this is what tells me  
what state is going to get the most money funded. Right? So what's weird is all the states are  
accepting this increase in funding.  
So that's a good change because that means they're going to release more state contracts. Um,so I know everyone's, uh, finances are totally different and not everyone could afford a mentor  
or going to the conference and stuff like that. So, um, net was actually the one who gave me  
this idea because she's always trying to think of doing stuff that's either free or that's like super  
cost efficient.  
So we're actually, oh shit. Well, she's a surprise guest at the webinar. Don't tell nobody.  
Um, so we're actually doing an online three hour event for, um, a step by step state funding for  
your care homes and unlicensed group homes. And just so you know, state funding is going to  
be from the home and community base funding. That Congress is already approving.  
It's a $400 billion funding that Congress is approving this year to go to all the states. Um, so  
what's cool about this is the type of funding that's with it. Um, I'm actually going to email all of  
y'all that register for this event.  
You're going to get a template and it's going to have all 50 states on it. It's going to look  
something like this. It's going to look something like this and it's going to have your own link  
and everything.  
And this is going to give you the direct link on how to get funding for seniors, right? Because  
there's so many different types of funding out there. Um, for state funding, I'm going to go  
through it and the webinar and explain each type of funding and what you could do to utilize it.  
You don't have to be licensed to utilize it.  
And also I'm going to speak about how you can get funding from the state. I'm going to talk  
about all the different types of ways you can get it. I would like two tacos, please.  
I'm going to post it in the link so y'all could see it. Also there is a 30% off discount if you use  
June, June sale, that's the discount code. And then we'll post it right now.  
And remember you don't have to be licensed to utilize this. Um, I think that's like the best part  
of it. So I know somebody asked about Louisiana.  
Um, so Louisiana, the best kind of funding they have there, it's going to be the community  
choice waiver. And as long as they're 21 years older, um, they could get it and you could utilize  
that in your own group home. That's unlicensed or, um, care home.  
That's unlicensed. Um, also too, there's a lot of, Oh, here we go. How could four million, how  
could $4 billion new federal dollars change Medicaid and home community services? Um, also  
there's a lot of nonprofits as well that will help out if they know you have some type of state  
funding and resident in your home.  
Um, especially the nonprofits. I noticed the ones that work with like sober living homes, uh,  
people who are dealing with, um, drug addiction, alcoholism, um, they're that type of nonprofit  
is really good to team up with because, um, I know in some States they offer state funding for,it's not for sober living, but it's for people who are considered disabled because they have some  
type of drug addiction or if they have HIV, there's some state funding for that. There's state  
funding for, um, seniors for disabled, for mentally challenged people, not just, um, their IQ  
that's low, but like actually mentally challenged.  
Like they have issues with, um, like schizophrenia, depression. So there's tons of state funding  
that is getting funded right now as we speak. And the process really isn't that complicated to  
get into.  
You just need to know where to look. Um, also to people forget that if there's state funding,  
that means there's also possibly County funding as well that you could tap into to help, um,  
increase your profits in your unlicensed group homes and care homes because people seem to  
forget like, Hey, people who can't afford to go into these assistant livings, they're going into the  
unlicensed and unlicensed group homes and care homes. So, you know, the government  
knows what's up.  
They just, this is like kind of like, okay, this is what we're going to do. We're going to do more  
state funding towards home and community based services about way the unlicensed  
population could utilize it. But there's no one teaching this.  
So hopefully y'all could join in the webinar. Like I said, it's only a one 99 and it's for three hours  
long. And if you can't make it at that time, the replay is always up for sale.  
So there's no fear in that. Um, Don, do you have any questions? I have a question. No, you're  
good.  
No, I have no, I have no questions, but I do want to highlight the fact that when we were in  
Atlanta, now, of course, obviously I'd seen Evie and her post and just the vast amount of  
information that she was just giving away, giving it away. And then my partner, uh, Bryant talks  
to her in Atlanta. Okay.  
I gave him a free step by step. Immediately after that, he came up to me and said, bro, we got  
to set up a call with people. We have to set up a call with Evie.  
He said, bro, the game that she just gave me was ridiculous because we have our hands in a lot  
of different pots. Yeah. And so, you know, when he said that, like, y'all don't know Bryant like  
that, but for him to say something like that is a very high regard.  
And so then I started talking to Evie as well there, and she was dropping some knowledge on,  
on me as well from different things, guys. And so I say all that to say this, if this is a path that  
you want to go down, we have somebody right here in our group who is extremely  
knowledgeable and not only extremely knowledgeable, but continuously going out to get more  
knowledge. If she doesn't know about a state, Evie's going to stay up at night to go in this state  
to get, to get the information, to deliver it to us in bite-sized pieces that we can digest it and  
understand it with.And for that, that 199 is pennies because I guarantee you, if she put a dollar amount on the  
time that she has spent to go up and research the information for us, that we have asked her  
on different States, 199 would be the first 20 minutes. Shit. Not even.  
Yeah. Not about to say first, probably. I know someone told me, um, whenever I start making,  
whenever I first started making a lot of wealth, and this is before, um, this is way back when,  
when I was in the car business and I made a shit load of money in it.  
Um, and then I left it because I wanted to do something more purposeful. I left with like no  
money. They're just like, whatever you made that year, that year I made like half a million.  
So that's like my salary. So divided by 40 hours, that's like the time, like I should charge people  
for my time. So like now, Oh, sorry.  
If y'all hear my son, he's autistic. So like now it's hard when people want to do consulting calls.  
Cause I never would do that until people started asking me to.  
And I'm like, fuck, I made all this money last year from one of my old mentors told me to do it  
like this. Then I would be charging like $400 for 30 minutes. So that's, I feel like this is the most  
cost efficient way for people to jump in to see if this is what they want to do or not.  
And they're getting a template for each state. Like I'm just a crazy person and I have a template  
for each state. So you don't have to oversell your value.  
So how do we get to you? How do I get the information? Now, how do we get your information?  
Oh, so I posted it in the link, the webinar that I'm hosting. And also in the future, Ned and I do  
have like this big thing that we're going to be launching, but it's not ready yet. So here we go.  
But yeah, being in the healthcare field is definitely amazing. I like studying all the different  
states and regulations. It's really crazy how the terminology is used in each state, right? Like a  
personal care home in one state, you might have to be licensed for it, but then in another state,  
it needs to be unlicensed and do it.  
And then I started tapping into Canada's market too, which is like a whole nother like game  
changer. So it's pretty awesome how like, if you just learn the bare minimum of how to do  
unlicensed group homes and how to exceed in it, how you could really go like nationally with  
this. And even in other countries, if you want it to, because I know why I love Dawn is because  
my background is in real estate, right? It's like, we don't rent none of our houses.  
We own all of them. And so one way we were able to scale so fast is because of our real estate  
properties. And we know how to like flip them or how to sell wholesale deals or how to sell  
subject to deals.  
And it's like our team, we all see the vision of what we want. And, and the best part of it is like,  
we're able to make all this money, but at the same time, we're able to like give back to ourcommunities and house them. Which I need to get four people out of my house.  
Cause there are these homeless people we took in that were IDD. So now we have to like go  
buy another house to fill it up for them. Cause it's crazy out there, man.  
There's so much need for this type of business that people just need to learn how to do it.  
Especially like if you're bilingual, there's like a lot of refugees that are coming in from the  
Middle East, from Africa, from parts of Central America. So I know I forgot what nonprofit it is  
and it's in Texas.  
It's in California. And it's in Louisiana where they're willing to pay you for like room and board if  
you take in these refugees. So that's like another thing we're getting tapped into.  
And it's, it's a lot y'all, but state funding, you can never go wrong, especially with home and  
community based services because home and community based services is the new Medicaid.  
So if you learn your state funding, you're essentially learning the Medicaid system and jumping  
through the loopholes like we do to be able to do that service in our unlicensed homes. Cause  
even though I did go down the license route, I have more unlicensed homes than I do license  
because it's easier to open and it's easier to scale and it's easier to get grant money.  
I know a lot of people ask me about grant money. If you check out HUD, HUD actually has  
grants for shared living homes, shared independent living homes. Shared independent living  
homes.  
It's on HUD. Yeah. Just go, go to the HUD website.  
You have to do a little bit of research there to get to it. But it's, yeah, there's a lot of different  
stuff out there. If you, you just got to go down some rabbit holes some nights, you know,  
there's one of two ways of getting the information.  
You're either going to go down a rabbit hole on your own to go get it or you're going to pay  
somebody who's already went down that rabbit hole for the information that they can give you.  
No, like we actually hired. So, you know, Don, like my main partner that was writing grants is  
actually going through a hard time and he's in rehab detoxing and he's going to be out for  
about two years.  
So I had to take on that grant writing role. If you're on our team, we're like, you know, we're  
ride or die. We're going to be with you forever.  
Right. So we ended up having to hire this grant writer and Oh my gosh, she's like amazing. She  
just saved me like three months work of typing and researching.  
And it's insane how much money there is, that the government it's just producing. And one of  
the biggest funding is Medicaid. And one of the main things that it nationally speaking, that  
legislation is trying to start cracking down on is the institutionalized housing.So like IDD, the intellectual developmental disabled population, they're trying to stop the  
assistant living type of feeling where eventually they're going to do it to where you don't have  
to have sprinkler systems in the house, right? Because they don't want it to feel  
institutionalized. They want it to feel more community based and more accepting in the  
neighborhood. So there's a big change coming around 20, I think it's 2030 is when they're  
supposed to like really start putting the hammer down.  
So like right now they're just distributing the funds. So that way different stuff could go into  
effect, but they need more people to get the contract and to utilize it the correct way. Also too, I  
noticed a lot of people were saying for Texas, like their contract was taking like three to five  
years.  
And then I started asking questions and it's because whenever they submit it, they kept making  
mistakes or they put the wrong Medicaid billing MPI number or they didn't have the correct  
criteria to match what the application stated. And, um, if they would've just hired a consultant,  
it would've been so much easier. Like I know whenever I paid someone for help, they didn't  
even know anything about Texas, but it's okay.  
I wasted $10,000 but I figured out how to do Texas from trial and error. And, um, that's why I  
offer these step-by-step courses or I post free step-by-step templates. So people can utilize it.  
They don't have that income. So it's definitely something to keep an eye out for. Make sure you  
follow my page step-by-step with Evie on Facebook.  
If you have any questions, you could always inbox me or just, uh, tag me in the post. Don, is  
that the end of our commercial? It's Hey, I'm, I'm, I'll be waiting on that on certain things, man.  
But I wanted to just kind of piggyback off of what you are, what you're talking about right now,  
especially with the government funding side of things, guys, we pay close attention.  
My, my partners and I to where the government is allocating money. Okay. Anywhere you see  
the government allocating money, you need to follow the rabbit hole.  
And what we like to do is go to when we see them allocate money towards something, what  
was the root problem? Why did they allocate money towards this? What was the root problem  
and what solution can we provide to the root problem to get to the money and provide the  
services that are needed? Wow. And I encourage each of you to do that as well. Anytime you  
hear about a grant you hear, because if you hear about one, there's typically others out there.  
So what is the, what is the reason that they even put a grant together for this? Um, EB stated on  
here that she lost, you know, she wasted a lot of money. Let me tell you guys something. There  
is no such thing as wasting money in business.  
And the reason I say that is because business has a tuition and there are no scholarships. Okay.  
Entrepreneurship has a tuition and there are no scholarships.You're either going to pay with time, money, or both. That is the form of payment that you're  
going to have to give up in order to get to the life that you desire. And when I say desire, that  
brings me into another thought process as we are, as you know, as we're waiting on, on that.  
But guys, how many people on here? And I think I've stated a lot of this before, or some of it  
before anyway, but put a one in the chat. If you consider yourself a procrastinator, if you're still  
with me, you're still tracking with this. You're still listening.  
Put a one in the chat. If you say, Hey, I tend to procrastinate a little bit. Oh my gosh.  
I do that with laundry, even though I have a housekeeper. That's a perfect example. Actually.  
That's a perfect example. You know, I hate laundry. So all of you people that are putting ones in  
the chat, let me tell you a secret.  
Okay. An open secret. There is no such thing as procrastination.  
Okay. Procrastination doesn't exist either. What there is is a lack of desire.  
The reason you're not getting up off your ass to go do the things that you are telling yourself  
that you're supposed to do. And then you are masking it by labeling yourself a procrastinator.  
That's incorrect.  
You are not going to do something that you do not desire to do. So I say that to say this, and  
some of this is going to punch you in the gut, but I told you earlier, I don't really pull punches. If  
you are still sitting on the sidelines and it's not a money issue.  
Okay. And we can't even use it anymore because quantum told us quantum told us how to  
overcome the money issue. Okay.  
He's told us how to overcome the money issue. So if you are still sitting on the sidelines of this  
group home business, gathering information and not taking that information and then going,  
put it into use somewhere to actually start taking action. And you're labeling yourself a  
procrastinator in that scene.  
That's playing out in your head. As you're telling yourself that you're supposed to be doing  
something and now you're not doing it. You do not yet have a large enough burning desire to  
get out of your current situation in life, to get to the situation that you would like to be.  
And if that is the case, that is okay, but recognize it. There has not been a bug that has bit you  
yet that says, I'm tired of where I am and I'm tired of how life is. And I am so tired of it that a  
desire, a white and blue burning hot flame of desire has ignited within me to take action and go  
do something about.  
So in anything you do in life, because this is something else you got to look at how you do  
anything is how you do everything. And once you recognize that, how you do anything is howyou do everything. Then you can ask yourself the followup question.  
Where else is that showing up in my life? Where are those little piss poor habits showing up in  
my life? The ones that's keeping me exactly where I'm at in life instead of allowing me to  
elevate to where I'm trying to get to. You don't have a procrastination problem. You have a  
desire problem or a lack of desire problem because when you get to that point where your  
desire becomes big enough, nothing is going to stand in your way.  
I promise you that you're going to knock down every door, window, shed, whatever it is, should  
get to where you get to in life. There will be no more. So true.  
Yeah. Cause I know when I started, I had a stroke. I had just got the COVID vaccine and within  
like 20 to 48 hours I had a stroke and we had like our first client moved in our house and it was,  
I didn't give up.  
I was in a walker still being a host home and just not giving a fuck. And it was because I just  
refused to go back to work for somebody. It was, it's just like that thought process of having  
someone tell me when to clock in or to clock out.  
You just, you're never going to tell me that again. And like, and I know I'm not trying to dog on  
college or whatever. I had finally got my LVN license and I was like, you know what, fuck this.  
I'm not even going to use it. I just, I'll hire staff. I don't need to be the employee if, you know,  
cause you have the entrepreneur mindset and then you have the CEO mindset on how I'm, how  
am I going to scale this business and then sell it? And I know like earlier we were talking about  
don't get too attached with a company that you have.  
So like back in my car business days, which we still own a car dealership now, but I'm silent  
investor. One of the key things we used to train ourselves team is don't get attached to the  
inventory, right? Because you're going to sell it. Like you already know you're gonna make  
money off of it.  
So what's so cool about this field that we're in, we're making money off of it, but we're living a  
lifelong impact on helping others. Like I was like blown away. I even got an award for like  
helping homeless people that are paying me from their SSI to house them in San Antonio.  
I was like, what the fuck? This is crazy, but okay. But it's like you have to have that really drive  
and consistency not to give up on yourself because you're the only one that is stopping you  
from achieving your goals. Even like what a disability, you know, like, you know, I'm on the  
spectrum and I was raised most of my life in special ed from elementary to middle school.  
I was in the special ed classes because of my autism and my developmental delayed and all this  
stuff. I was able to test out of it to go on to the on level course and stuff like that. But I just  
didn't give up though.Like I kept whatever obstacle came in my way. You just keep going over it and figuring it out. I  
think that's why I'm so good at researching because I researched how to get out of the special  
ed because I was like, look, just because I'm dyslexic and I can't read, write, don't mean I can't  
Excel.  
Um, but you just have to stay positive and keep being ambitious and learn whenever a door  
closes, you just build another one and you keep going because that's the only way you're going  
to be successful in anything, no matter what you do. You just, you just reminded me of  
something. Then we'll get that back on.  
She told me she's ready. Um, guys, when you, and it was because of what he stated. All right.  
There is a, and I've talked about this before as well. Something happened to you versus  
something, something happening for you. Okay.  
And Evie just said, you know, I was dyslexic and I was in special ed, but then she finished off her  
sentence. And all too often a lot of us state that. And when we say statements like that, we are  
unconsciously taking on a slight victim mindset.  
This and this, but look at this. So I want you guys in your everyday language, cause I pay  
attention to language religiously and the use of words and the type of language and words that  
I utilize when speaking. So if you have that issue where you state a problem or something, and  
then you replace it with the butt and you tell the glorious story after that, I want you to start  
replacing that with air.  
So in this sense, Evie would be, I had dyslexia. I was in special ed classes. I tested out of them  
and now I own a car dealership, a real estate business, IDD homes.  
So now it's a big door story and not a victim story, which those little, those little tiny changes  
like that can make all the difference in the world replace, but with, and to tip when you're telling  
the story. And I wasn't raised by my mom or dad. I was raised by my grandma, but not like it  
matters.  
There's, that's a whole nother story, but I love my parents still. There we go. Nettie.  
Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate you and all the work that you're constantly doing. Thank you,  
Don.  
You're awesome. No problem, man. All right, guys, let's, uh, I'm here.  
All right. So we're picking right back up where we left off. Thank you.  
211 people that are still on here. I know East coast is late as hell. I know, but stay with us y'all.  
And, uh, thank you. Thank you all. Real talk on, on that.So let's, let's pick up where we left off of this. Yes. So, um, I get it's Thursday.  
I've had my hearing with the judge. The judge said that they're going to, uh, talk to the  
prosecutors and the DA to see if they can certify me as an adult for the crime that I committed.  
Not understanding what this stuff means.  
Um, I know it's bad because my daddy, so, um, I go home, my dad, you know, my dad would  
wait. I don't wait, wait for me and my sister. Um, it was a quiet ride home.  
Let me tell it. Uh, my daddy sitting outside, never really sit outside his lawn chair, sitting  
outside. Uh, he asked me for a minute.  
He asked me to come outside and let me talk, let him talk to me. At this point, again, um, I  
didn't, I didn't admit to my daddy that I did this because I realized at this point what I did, I, I'm  
emped up. You, you, you, you, you, you don't cross the line.  
You don't cross the gun line. So I'm like, not that I wanted to lie to my daddy. Uh, but I wanted  
to try to work, ease his, ease his worrying because I knew that if he knew that I did what they  
said, I did, he, he would just go, you know, be worried sick.  
Um, because at this point I was probably going to prison. So, um, he brought me outside and  
that was like his moment to say he wanted to call truth. He said, Nick, um, you don't have  
nothing else to prove.  
This is what my daddy told me. He said that you don't have anything else to prove. He said, you  
know, you don't fall.  
Um, you know, being a juvenile, he said, everybody that's around, you know, you'll fight. He  
basically was like, you don't, you don't have to prove yourself to nobody. You don't have to  
fight.  
You don't have to argue. They know who they messing with now. And he told me to make a  
promise to him that before I fight, before I hit somebody else back, then I would just call the  
police.  
And to hear my daddy say that, I just knew that I had a messed up because he was not the  
person to tell me to call the laws. I ain't never seen my daddy call the police, like call the police.  
He said, you don't got nothing else to prove before you fight again, and pick up the phone and  
just call the police.  
And I was like, and I told him, I said, okay, daddy. Um, it's so done. It's crazy.  
This may sound, we're going into the next phase of this story. I get a call from my children's  
father's family, my child's father, which is my daughter's dad, my baby daddy. I don't know  
what you call it.You know, it's been so long. We'll call him Josh. Josh family called me to let me know that he had  
passed away.  
At this point, I was not hurt. I didn't cry. I was like, okay.  
Because all the things that I could focus on right now was at this point was I'm in a bind  
because of him and his girlfriend. I'm facing 20 years for aggravated assault with dealing with  
me. My daddy told me, he said, Nick do you realize that by the time you get out of prison, your  
daughter will be grown and I'll be dead.  
That's how he changed that conversation. So I had to think, you know, I just sat in my room at  
this point. Now I'm scared because now I got a one year old and if I do get 20 years, my  
daughter be 21 years old when I get out of prison.  
And so that's all I was thinking about at the time. I'm not thinking about Josh being dead. I'm  
not thinking about nothing other than what, you know, is life going to look like for me and my  
child over a mistake that I made from being angry because this girl said that, you know, my  
baby wasn't his getting a DNA test, you know, just, you know, I, I just became upset for nothing.  
Uh, looking back on it. Um, so I had a hearing my, my second hearing to, to realize, I mean, my  
second hearing to the time wasn't that I was going to be certified as an adult. Um, maybe a  
week after Josh deal and he committed suicide.  
He shot himself in the head in front of his girlfriend that I was in, you know, court with. Um, and  
so when it came time for me to go to my hearing, they continued the hearing due to the fact of  
her mental anguish of, being, you know, witnessing him taking his own life in front of her. So  
they reset my court date, continued it.  
So I had to go once, um, months and months wondering, you know, what's going to happen to  
me. I'm not, I mean, I'm in, I'm a, I'm in high school. I'm a senior in high school.  
I'm just going through the motion every day, getting up, going to school and just, you know,  
wondering what's going to happen to me. Go ahead. For those of you on here who have, um,  
not had the misfortune of going through something within the criminal justice system.  
I can tell you from firsthand experience that that is the most uncomfortable feeling in the  
world, that right to a speedy trial stuff. Let me tell you what that is. You're right to a speedy trial  
is if it happens within five years, it is not fun.  
I was talking a little bit about anxiety and anticipation earlier. Ain't no anticipation in that one.  
It's straight anxiety.  
Day in, day out, some point in your day, at least for an hour of your day, every day it is on your  
mind. And it sucks. Yeah.  
So, uh, by the time my court date come, you know, the family take off work. We all let the court,uh, the prosecutor lets me know. Um, the only reason why they weren't going to certify me as  
an adult and push, uh, the case further was because Josh, which was the common denominator  
between me and the person that I assaulted, had passed away.  
And so they let me go. Due to my child's father being dead, me and her shouldn't have any  
other communication. So it was like his death set me free.  
That, you know, we all have angels and gods in our life, whether you know it or not. Sometimes  
that little voice that's in your head. But let me tell you something that your entire life through it  
all.  
It's been, I mean, cause we only had what, 17 right now. God's hand never came off. Okay.  
There might've been times where it felt like it wasn't there. There might've been times where  
you wanted to run away from and go do your own thing. But that's been the common theme  
throughout tonight is that through this all his hand has continuously been on and over your life  
because this could have went several different terrible ways, several.  
And the fact that you right now pushing close to the seven figure club, the fact that you right  
now have a group with 41,682 people, as I checked earlier, the fact right now that you have  
eight homes running, several business opportunities are what I would call leading the nation  
from a group home perspective, as far as getting the collective together to get educated on,  
produce new group homes and help as many people as we possibly can. And for all of us in  
here, I want you guys to know that as well. We are the collective right now that are changing  
the way that certain demographics in America are treated behind the work that we're doing  
with the group homes that we're opening and for you to be the leader of that after after  
everything that you've been through is a testimony in and of itself.  
You don't have, I'm like your daddy right now. You don't have anything else to prove except to  
yourself. That's it.  
Nobody else. You don't know us. Shit.  
I'm being really real, but wait, there's more. So he went through with you yet. So keep going.  
Yeah. So, um, well, before the news that I was, you know, basically everything was going to be  
dropped. Um, I had to go through the funeral, um, the, the family hour when I went to the  
family hour, matter of fact, my daughter, my daughter, uh, she was one year, she was one year  
old.  
Um, I went to the family hour, the girl was there and she made a big fuss, you know, why is she  
here? She tried to take my life screaming and yelling. And I'm still numb at this point because I  
was on house arrest. I was on house arrest.  
Um, I got permission to go to this family hour. Um, and so now, you know, I'm scared cause youknow, she's there acting a fool. Her family is there.  
And I know, I, you know, I know me how I would typically respond to this situation. So now, you  
know, I had to walk off and, you know, just try to keep my cool. Um, his daddy was, you know,  
talked to her and said that, you know, she, she had a relationship with him.  
She had a child by him. She deserves to be here. Uh, and he pretty much, you know, put her in  
her place.  
I'm not sharing the first tier. I'm just, I'm just there at this point. Um, at the funeral, I was, uh,  
um, ushered in his funeral, still numb to whatever the, everything that was going on.  
I'm only just in my mind. I know I gotta pay for what I did. Um, it wasn't up until the casket  
started rolling out of the church that I said, you know, this is real.  
My daughter's dad is gone. And so that's when I, you know, broke down and cried. Reality set in  
on me, went to court that was, you know, um, it was over.  
So I, I just felt like I had like a second chance. Um, and I, I pretty much, I could say that I took  
advantage of a second chance. Um, I did get into a fight maybe two, maybe two, quite two  
years later, but I had mentally said, I'm going to keep it simple.  
I'm not gonna take nothing with me. You know, it's going to be a simple fight. And that was it.  
So I didn't do that, but, um, was that my last fight? It was my last fight or other people. I had  
fight in my relationships, but, um, as far as fight somebody else, that was my last fight. The girl  
came to my house.  
That's all, you know, how that go. But, um, I mean, I said, I was here. I keep meeting.  
Um, so after that I did have a simple assault. Now they didn't press charges. It was simple.  
Um, regular street fight. I was good on that one. But anyways, during this time, my dad get a  
phone call from one of my kids auntie.  
So that was my great one. He told my, she told my dad that my grandma, my grandmother was  
diagnosed with cancer, cervical cancer. And, um, my grandmama didn't want her to, you know,  
tell any of her children.  
Prior to that time, we had got a call from her having cervical cancer and she was going through  
chemo radiation and he had cleared up this time. They gave the call and said that, you know,  
the cancer had came back. Granny wasn't going through any more treatments and they, um,  
they gave her three months to live.  
And so that was like, granny, you know, that was like my mama, my grandmama, she kept the  
family together. She was the glue. Uh, we, every celebration, every holiday we went to grannyhouse.  
And my grandmama was a woman who was always positive. She never said a bad thing about  
anybody. Um, God fearing went to church.  
She, she just loved her family. And so that was the mama that I knew growing up. And, um, so  
my daddy told us, we were all just known like life, you know, we know we got three months.  
Um, at this point I am 17 still. So my, my, my children's father died. My children, Josh died May  
of 2020 10\.  
Um, when the hospital called, well, granny ended up going into the hospital, maybe two or  
three weeks after we found out she only had three months to live. They said that, um, she was  
short of breath. She was at home and she was short of breath.  
And so we all rushed to the hospital. They had to do CPR. And so I'm 17 years old.  
All of her children are there. Um, she's alert now. We were able to go into the room with her  
and, um, um, this was August, the end of August.  
And so last night I talked to my, you know, I talked to my grandmama, I'm, you know, scared.  
Um, as to how she doing, as to how she feeling, letting her know that I love her. Uh, we all got  
around her bed and she told last night, she said to us that, you know, um, I'm gonna make a  
cake for you for your birthday.  
Granny made our, everybody's cake. Anybody birthday was granny made our cake. And so I  
was like, okay, you know, at this point I'm going to turn 18 years old.  
Um, at least that's something I got to look forward to. Granny said your cake is coming. So  
granny ain't a woman to tell you no story.  
So I had that, I had that to look forward to. Um, um, so we all go out the room. I don't know if it  
was like something on the, you know how to alarm speak and everything.  
Yeah. So, uh, granny, they, they wanted us out and they had to come in. And, um, now my dad  
and his siblings sitting around making the decision because basically she was cold and again,  
and they had already broke ribs and, um, they had to make a decision whether they wanted to  
resuscitate her.  
Right. And so the decision was made to not do it. Um, so then they, I lost my grandmother.  
So I'm, I'm, I'm 17 years old, almost 18 having to bury my grandma. And this is the person that I  
knew to be my mother all my life. And that was a hard pill to swallow because even though my  
mama had passed away, even though my maternal grandmother had passed away, even  
though Josh passed away, death didn't seem like death until granny passed away.Everybody else went on, uh, it was sad, you know, but when granny, when granny left, it was a  
blow. It was a blow. Um, that's when the family fell apart.  
That's what arguments had was had. Um, you didn't look forward to holidays no more. Life had  
changed drastically.  
So, um, I go through, I go through life. Um, I'm dating this guy. And he was much older than  
me.  
My dad had found out about it and I get kicked out the house. And before I graduated high  
school, I'm living alone. We have some significant deaths.  
So I ain't going to even call it brushes with the law. You was in there. You was in there.  
Now the Lord looked over you both times on those situations, both times. And then to pile on  
top of all of that, you're rock. I'm gonna call him your rock.  
And now I know anytime I need you to do something, I'm gonna say, Charles said, that's how I  
started out. But now you're alone. The man that was your rock pulled everything out from  
under you because of his disagreement with the age of the person that you were dating, who  
was much older.  
Him as a man and me as a man, as a man with daughters, not just a man, as a man with  
daughters, understand exactly how he was feeling inside. So the guy was dating, um, I'm not  
going to say the age, uh, discrepancy, but, or the age gap, but he was significantly older than  
me. And my daddy was hurt because, uh, he felt as if he wasn't doing, you know, he felt like,  
you know, usually they say, or what he told me was girls that date older men have daddy  
issues.  
It was something that he felt like he didn't do right. And so I was in love from an older man.  
And so that crushed my daddy.  
Um, but in actuality, that wasn't the case, but that's how he felt. And so he told me, um, he said,  
you know, he not going to take care of another man's woman. And I had to go.  
And so at this time, I'm 17, I'm still 17 years old. Um, in, in, in, um, I mean, in, uh, I'm a senior.  
So reality sitting in, because even though I got put at my daddy's house and I was dating a guy  
much older than me, I had to sleep in my car for a week.  
That guy didn't have nowhere for me to go. So during all of this, I'm working a job. I got a one-  
year-old, um, she's in daycare.  
I'm still going to school. I'm trying to figure out how I'm a joke of everything because I'm  
sleeping in my car on the freeway, um, on the freeway doors locked, um, sleeping every night,  
uh, in the morning time for school, I go to a truck stop, take me a whole day off and go to class  
every day. Um, I didn't have a job.I was able to say I had a little, little money saved. I was able to get enough money to be able to,  
um, get me an apartment. I had to go to the courts to get emancipated, to be able to get an  
apartment before age 18\.  
Right. So I'm, you know, juggling all of these, um, don't, you know, I feel alone. Don't really  
want to deal with nobody.  
I didn't, I would have to, after my daddy go to sleep at night, call my sister and see if she could  
see, you know, meet her outside for her to take my daughter for me, sneak my daughter in the  
house, drive back to my daddy's house before his alarm get off in the morning and get my  
daughter from my sister. So my sister was like my support group, where it came to my  
daughter and I'm sneaking her in my daddy's house. So she not having to sleep in the car with  
me.  
Um, I ended up getting my apartment. Um, my dad is not talking to me at all. Didn't have it, you  
know, anything, nothing to say to me cause you know, I don't hurt in anger.  
I come to my high school graduation. Okay. My sister graduated with highest honors.  
So everybody that graduated with honors walk first. Right. So even twins and I met, you know,  
we was side by side.  
So she graduated with highest honors. She was like one of the first 15 people out of our class to  
walk the line. And even though my dad wasn't talking to me, I was like, you know, at least he  
here to see me graduate.  
At least he, you know, in spite of all things, he's, I made it, you know, right after graduation, one  
of my aunties called me and said that after they called my sister name, my daddy got up and  
left. So, you know, in my mind I'm like, okay, my daddy's, you know, was there to watch me  
graduate, even though he wasn't talking to me, at least he was able to be there, you know, to  
watch me walk the line. I graduated high school.  
That was something that he wanted me to do. My auntie called me and let me know that he got  
up and walked off. So my plans was to graduate.  
I got my outfit ready. We finna go downtown. We finna have fun.  
I sat in my apartment and cried on graduation day because my auntie took, you know, took that  
away from me. Took that joy away from you. Yeah.  
And so, um, my daddy had bought my sister like a ring, I think a neck clip, you know, he bought  
her graduation gifts. I had to hear about that. I didn't get nothing for graduation from nobody.  
I didn't get nothing. And so, um, I got over it, you know, cried that first day and got over it like I  
always get over stuff. Um, and, um, so by this time my sister going to college, she went to  
Jackson state university.So my sister gone to college. We all drive down. It's like an hour and some change away from,  
uh, my hometown.  
You know, I go off to see my sister, my daddy there, you know, just, just immediate family  
there. It wasn't, it wasn't late. She was probably five of us.  
Uh, we go see her off to college. We in her dorm, you know, looking around and everything like  
that. I leave, we all leave.  
And then maybe a few months after that, I had been trying to reach out to my dad. I've been,  
you know, coming, you know, over to try to apologize because what he thought I was doing  
wasn't what I was doing, but he wasn't accepting of any of that. Um, and one day he ended up  
letting me in.  
So my brother, my brother still lived there, but he worked. My sister was in college and it was  
just me. And so, um, he ended up letting me in.  
We ended up being able to talk a little bit and then, you know, he was able to tell me how he  
felt about everything that went on or whatever. And he told me, so my dad kept a picture of me  
and my daughter when she was, she wasn't, uh, she wasn't even probably two months old. He  
had blew up this big old picture.  
I think it was the biggest thing he could get it in. And then my mama had different, she had like  
some, of course, you know, they lived together. And so she had some, um, decorations, wild  
decorations around it or whatever.  
I went to his house and the picture of me and my daughter was off the wall. And that was  
always there. And, uh, he had it on a calendar.  
When I walked in the room, when I walked in his living room, cause that's what we was talking  
at. I noticed that my picture was gone. And you know, it was hurtful or whatever.  
And so we just randomly talking. I noticed it gone, but I don't say nothing. And he randomly  
talking.  
And so I guess he knew that I knew that it was gone. And he said, um, basically he just told me,  
he was like, man, I'm proud of you. Um, basically everything that was thrown at me, him  
putting me out.  
I was able to, you know, get my apartment, graduate high school, keep my job, pay my car  
note. It didn't break me. And, uh, you know, he had like a shelf in the living room.  
He said, I want you to come up over here and pull that frame from under that shelf. When I  
picked it up, I knew it was a picture of me and my daughter. He said, told me to go put it back  
on the wall.And so I put the picture back on the wall and he, you know, expressed to me that that's when I  
learned that he was upset because he felt as if I was dating this man because it was something  
that he wasn't doing. And I told him, I said, well, daddy, how can you feel that way when you 20  
years older than my mom? And he told me, he said, your mama was looking for a way out. And  
so he automatically put me in that same classification like everybody else like you, just like your  
mom because he knew that my mama was dating him because she had all these other siblings  
that they are competing with.  
Uh, she have a child, um, she's young and you know, the saying of you dating the old, older  
man, cause you know, taking his check or you need to be killed. You need to be taken care of.  
So he knew that that was my mama's angle with him, but that wasn't my angle when I was  
dating the guy that I was dating.  
I was going to say, you know, the, the amount of parallels in your story, I don't know if I've seen  
this amount of parallels in somebody's life story before between them, their parents and just  
the way that things have happened and transpired. From the age that you had a child to the  
age gap between, which obviously you didn't disclose, but the age gap between, you know,  
your father and mother, and then you and this other gentleman, which ultimately ultimately led  
to a breakdown. And it kind of leads me to wonder as well how your dad, you know, if your dad  
thought about all of that.  
And if there was some type of guilt with him of actually feeling like he didn't do enough,  
because man, like when I'm, when I'm looking here, you know, again, I'm going to be real with  
you guys. I don't really believe in generational curses. I believe in generational mindsets.  
I believe the mindsets of our parents and grandparents and great grandparents are what get  
passed down to us. And we call it a curse because we really don't know how to, how to break  
the mindset that they've given to us because now we've become a product of our environment.  
But in this sense right here with your story, man, it was like, it was completely surrounding you.  
Everything that was thrown at you was thrown at you from a societal standpoint to fail  
everything. Your story is a true story that ends with the words, but God period, everything that  
I'm hearing and going through right here, that's the only, those are the only two words that  
you could say at the end of everything that you've got to say. Your life is a testimony for others.  
I told people on the video earlier that I made that you should not, you won't be able to leave  
here with excuses. I didn't realize how true that would be. You know, some of that stuff is  
hyperbole when you say the videos cause you want people to come in, but damn, like it's facts.  
So before we get out of here, I want to let you know, I'm proud of you. If we don't say it enough  
here tonight, if we don't talk about it enough through our private conversations, but keep  
going. So at that point me and my dad's relationship started getting better.  
I was going over to check on him, spend time with him. Me and my dad was really, really, reallyclose. We talked every single day when he got off work.  
This is prior to me getting kicked out just as a child. My daddy had a routine. When he got off  
work, he came in and fix himself a cup of coffee.  
He wanted to have that coffee before Nick came in front of her mouth. I just started being  
alone with it. I've been alone with it all my life because, you know, I sat down and talked to my  
daddy.  
I could just quote anything, you know, from my daddy. We spent time together. We spent years  
and years just, you know, me and him and just him and his kids.  
That's all he looked forward to. My sister ended up coming home from college and she stayed  
at my daddy's house and she called me and she said, Nick, something is wrong with daddy. He  
making a weird noise.  
And so I stopped what I was doing. I went over to my dad's house and me and my sister, we in  
the living room, whispering back and forth, you know, she was like, you know, you're going to  
hear the noise. And so we just quiet listening for the noise that he's going to make.  
He make the noise and I'm like, you know, what is, you know, what's going on with that or  
whatever. And, um, bag up. My dad, my car, my car had ended up getting, um, my brakes was  
bad on my car.  
I tell my daddy, um, my brakes are bad. He takes my car to get fixed. I go and pick up my car.  
My daddy was a type that if I came to visit him, he wanted to see me while I was there. So he  
was in the restroom. And I said, you know, I'm here to get my keys.  
Um, and he said, all right, your keys in the, you know, on the table. And so I thought that was to  
be the strangest thing because like, Oh, you know, even just all the people, they want to come  
in. Hold on one minute.  
I'll be there. You know, the bathroom, he let me leave without seeing me. And I was like, you  
know, that was kind of odd, but I didn't think nothing of it.  
Cause I was trying to get in my car and go, but I, you know, that was like, okay, that was weird.  
But I didn't think nothing of it. So anyway, uh, we hear the noise, uh, call, we called my guy,  
daddy.  
We let our guy, daddy know that, you know, something was wrong with my daddy. Can you  
come over there and, um, see what's going on with my daddy. Turns out my dad was in there  
drunk.  
So the noise he was hearing, um, it was just alcohol related when he didn't come out to the  
restaurant that day for me to, for him to see me because he was drunk. He was hiding from me.And again, uh, when I was young, I didn't know my dad had to drink.  
I didn't know that. So my dad, and of course he's older, more experienced, been around away.  
He know a drunk person.  
When he see a drunk person, he, he know it. So me and my sister, we're outside my daddy's  
room on some, uh, milk crates trying to eavesdrop on what was going on in the bedroom. And  
that's when we learned that my daddy was drinking alcohol.  
And so, um, this was a whole new person. This, this was a whole new person. Um, I didn't know  
this man.  
Every day I visit him, this went on, he's drunk. He was, I want to say 63 years old. He quit his job.  
He, uh, his disability early. Um, so he, at this point he just drinking his money. Sometimes we'll  
go in the house.  
He's drunk. He passed out. At this point, my brother was in nursing school.  
My sister's in college. Both of them ended up down sparing in school because of the behaviors  
that my daddy is having. And so, um, this is around fall of 20 to 2011\.  
I graduated, I graduated, I graduated high school, May of 2011 just started getting a  
relationship with my daddy. And around September of 2011 is when he relapsed with alcohol.  
So, um, there was no granny to call her son and say, you need to get your shit together.  
She didn't cuss, but she would pick, you know, get him, take him to a rehab, make him get  
soap. He didn't have nobody other than his children. We were, we're all at this point we're 19 or  
18 and my brother is 20\.  
So, and so we're not knowing what to do. Um, I called his siblings. I asked one of his brothers  
like, Hey, my daddy is acting strange.  
He's been drinking. We need help. He's not listening to us cause we are his children.  
He's not listening to his children. My uncles wouldn't, um, aid and assistance. Uh, so now we  
just dealing with my daddy.  
And so during that time he's reliving his past, he's reliving my mom. Um, you know, uh, when I  
was pregnant, I was mad. One of my uncles told me that the reason why my mama passed  
away was because my daddy picked her, he picked up a tricycle and hit her in her head, cause  
her to go crazy.  
And that's how she passed away. So, um, I'm probably 14, 15 years old at this time. Um, having  
some type of, no, I'm about 13\.  
So now I have hate in my heart for my daddy because he's the reason why my mom passedaway. And so, uh, I wrote a letter to him while I was pregnant and he never did respond to my  
letter. Uh, I knew that he read the letter because I saw the letter on his coffee table, but he  
never, he never, uh, read it.  
I mean, he never responded to me. I said, and that's when he told me the story about what my  
uncle had told me. He told me that my mom was extremely tall compared to him.  
He's like five to six feet. My mama, um, they had to get a custom made casket for her because  
of her, her weight, her size. And so with her having a mental health issue and, uh, you know,  
with bizarre behavior, he did in fact, pick up a tricycle and hit her with it to prevent her from  
jumping on him because of her manic state.  
But, you know, he let me know that, you know, my, at that point, that's when I understood that  
my mama had a mental illness. At that point, he talked about, you know, he didn't know who he  
was coming home to every day. He didn't know if she was going to be normal or was she going  
to be in a manic state? Um, and so he did do that to her and, but it cleared up, you know, me  
thinking that my, my daddy was the reason why, uh, away.  
And so, you know, I just, he, he just started laying out a lot of, um, things about the past things  
about my mama. Uh, and then things just got too frustrating, too stressful. Uh, this wasn't my  
daddy, you know? And I said, I w I was like, you know, I, I can't live like this.  
Me and my sister would literally stay at home to, you know, keep every door locked, hide his car  
keys, everything to keep him from drinking. It was, it was a constant battle. Um, every single  
day with us fighting against him, he was a whole different person drunk.  
And so, um, I ended up getting a job out for in Texas. I was like, by this time I'm 19 years old.  
Um, we in 2012 now, June of 2012\.  
So less than a year, um, we, we dealing with this new person, the alcoholic version of him. And  
so I tell him, I say, I was scared to tell my daddy cause I'm still, you know, like feel like a child.  
Like how I'm going to tell my daddy I'm fixing to move eight hours away.  
So I maybe like two or three weeks before I moved, I had everything in place. Got my  
apartment approved. My sister agreed to keep my daughter where I get on my feet.  
Um, and I'm about to go, I'm still dating this guy that I got put out for and he thought it was a  
good idea for us to move to Texas. So I ended up applying for the job, got the job. And so now  
I'm telling my daddy that I'm fixing to move to Texas.  
And so, um, I let him know, I said, daddy, I got a job paying $18 an hour in Texas at the time I  
was making $10 an hour. And I told him that I was leaving and he just told me, he said, um,  
again, he told me that he was proud of me. I told me that, uh, you know, go see the world.  
He saw the world. Uh, ain't nothing here. Um, which was in Meridian.Right, right. So, uh, I felt good about it and he asked me to give him a hug. And so my daddy  
wasn't an affectionate person.  
He wasn't like the, I love you, kissing us, hugging us. He wasn't that guy. But me and my sister  
would always go and hug my daddy, kiss my daddy on the cheek, tell him we love him and stuff  
like that.  
So he wanted a hug. So, you know, I gave him a hug. He was drunk.  
Um, but it was all good. So now I feel like I ain't got my daddy's blessings. Right.  
I get on the road, go to Texas. Um, I'm in Texas for a week at this point. My sister called me and  
said that my daddy's trying to jump on my brother.  
My brother is, um, quiet guy, not confrontational. He's in nursing school. Uh, he just played his  
video games, never been in trouble a day in his life.  
And it's like, you know, that bothered me. So I clocked out that Friday. I got on the road and  
went to my daddy and I've never disrespected my daddy.  
I never cussed in front of my daddy. I never disrespected him, but that was like the ultimate. He  
crossed the line.  
Yeah. So I shoot home. I go through the bus, through the door.  
And I asked him like, what's wrong with you? I said, out of all your, uh, siblings at this time, a lot  
of my dad's siblings children have been in prison, been in jail, dropped out of school. Like you  
got the perfect batch of children. Like, why are you doing this to my brother? So I'm telling him  
like, you know, you don't have to do us like this.  
So I'm, you know, pleading with him to try to get him help, you know, just pleading with him.  
I'm just frustrated because I'm tired of the battle. Like daddy, why are you doing this? We took  
him to the hospital.  
Um, he, he was thinking he had cancer because he had a stomach issue. My sister know what  
the term is. Um, it's a, it's a stomach bug, but you had to say antibiotics to clear it up.  
I Lori for Lori explore, explore. He had that. And so, um, he diagnosed himself with cancer.  
And so he's just drinking and going on and he finna check out here pretty soon. And, um, he  
needed was some prescriptions. Doctors say he pretty much at good health, you know, he had  
like some cholesterol, a little high blood pressure in the eighth floor.  
But my daddy always leaned on Walgreens, uh, over the counter prescription, over the counter  
medicine and could cure whatever was going on with him. And since his mother had passed  
away from cancer, he just diagnosed himself with cancer. So even though the doctor told himhe didn't have cancer, uh, he just couldn't get it together.  
But my, like I say, my daddy dealt with PTSD, he dealt with depression. And so he wasn't hip to  
all of this new stuff. He just go based off of what he knew.  
And then the struggles of the military, um, he used to say he would lay in his bed at night and  
relive all of that stuff. This is stuff that's going on that we don't know about. Right.  
Of course. So this was my Vietnam. Vietnam.  
Yeah. Yeah. My uncle, my great uncle went through the same thing.  
Like Agent Orange, um, flashbacks, horrible PTSD and yeah, that's what he went through. And  
so, um, at this point, I'm just mad. But of course it was, this was months and months of battle.  
My sister getting into it with him. It, listen, it was a battle or whatever. I was just in my breaking  
point.  
So at this point I'm, I'm shooting home to just give him a piece of my mind or whatever. And so  
he calmed down cause he, he was just weird when he was drunk, he calmed down. And, um, I  
ended up getting back on the road to go home, back to Texas.  
And, uh, so I go through my next week of work. I got my first paycheck. I called my daddy's on a  
Friday.  
I was headed to wood forest. I'm like, daddy, guess how much my check is. I'm excited.  
I'm talking to him and letting him know how much my check was. And I was heading into wood  
forest and I said, dad, I'm gonna call you back. And so he had just got a cell phone.  
He wasn't really used to cell phones. And so anytime he wouldn't answer, I'd call my sister and  
tell her to, you know, go plug up daddy's phone or, you know, tell him to call him. So I said, I'll  
call you back or whatever.  
But I was exhausted or whatever. Cause the odd days that I had was spent traveling back and  
forth and come back. And I just did my work week.  
And so, um, I want to say it was on a Sunday. My sister called me. And she was like, um, how did  
she word it? She called me and she said she was knocking on the door, but my daddy wasn't  
answering the door.  
And at this time, my brother went to work. And so I told her, I was like, girl, I hope he ain't in  
there dead like that. Just being so she was like, she pretty much, I'm sure like, girl, shut the fuck  
up and hung up in my face.  
I was like, this motherfucker being sensitive, but don't know. My sister, um, goes to my  
brother's job and get the key to get in the house. Because again, you could be knocking on thatdoor.  
And my daddy, you know, when he get drunk, he don't, he didn't care. He was knocking. He  
didn't care if it was us.  
He was just, he just was like that. So my sister goes, get the key, go back to the house, walk  
through the door and see my daddy laying on his bed. During this time, my daddy had, um, put  
his bed in the living room because I don't know what he would, I think it was because he would  
get too drunk, come make it all the way to the back of the house.  
And so he had these big, uh, buckets, you know, how the, like, uh, paint come in these big  
buckets when you try and paint the whole house real big plastic. So he was peeing. Yeah.  
He was peeing nose. And so she said she walked through the door and he was laying on the,  
uh, laying on his bed and she said she walked up to him and grabbed his arm. Cause my sister  
was a little bit more feisty than me.  
Like she didn't play with my daddy. I played with him. I was about to say, we're going to clarify  
that because according to the story, you way more feisty than him.  
Her nerves was a little bit more bad. She didn't, she didn't have time for it. You know, she, at  
this point she like, look, I ain't got time for this.  
So her and my daddy bumped heads a little bit more than what me and him did because I'm  
still holding on to who he was and my sister's reality checked in to you. Yeah. So she said she  
walked in like trying to snatch his arm.  
Like you hear me knocking at the door and his arm was still passed away. So rigor mortis has  
set in. Yeah.  
So my sister, uh, called me at this time. My god daddy was on my way on the way with my  
furniture. The guy that I was dating at the time, uh, had just made it and, uh, I'm he in the, he in  
the shower.  
I'm in the living room. My god, that had made it yet. He was on his way to me.  
So we just talking about how Texas meant for me, me and the guy I was dating. And, um, my  
sister called and she called crying and told me my daddy was gone. And so I was numb, like  
what, you know, questioning everything, like why, how, because we just had took him to the  
doctor and nothing was wrong with him.  
But how has he gone? You know? And, um, other people started calling my phone saying that  
my daddy wasn't dead. And they said that cause I was on my way to Mississippi. And so they  
were saying, Oh, your daddy is not dead.  
Uh, he's on his way to the hospital. So now my sister arguing and fighting with the neighborsand the other family that's calling me because they was, she was saying, you know, don't lie to  
my sister. Cause you know, now I'm just like, what's going on? Mixed bag emotions.  
You're getting too because this lady is saying, you know, he is okay. And so my sister called me  
back, cussing, you know, going off saying that they lied and my daddy is gone. And so now I  
just hit the floor crying, uh, angry, just, you know, mix of emotions.  
So I get on the road and I go to, um, go back home and, um, you know, prepare for the funeral,  
arguing with my family members. It was, it was, it was definitely a show. And so during my  
daddy's funeral, I'm still a mixed emotions, mad, saying stuff that I probably shouldn't be  
saying on the microphone.  
And I get up and walk out. Uh, my brother, he didn't show up to the funeral. I left the funeral.  
And so my sister was left there to, um, bury my daddy, uh, by herself. But before the funeral, of  
course we had the family album. And so, um, during the family hour, I'm grieving seeing my  
daddy.  
Um, the guy that I was dating was screwing the funeral home on. So as I'm, yeah. So as I'm  
grieving, you know, saying my final goodbyes at the family hour, there's this lady was like,  
time's up, you know, like real insensitive.  
Um, I'm like, you know, what's her, what's her problem? Cause I was like, you know, I was like,  
what's, what's her problem. Right. So I left that alone.  
The day of the funeral, when they opened up the doors, um, when I opened up the doors, um, I  
never had put him on any of my daddy's paperwork. Okay. I only put my number on there.  
And so when they started calling and said, you know, do you want to open up the doors? That's  
why I put two and two together. I said I didn't put your number on any of the paperwork. Why  
is she calling you? And so things started, you know, going south from there.  
Um, so she was the person that was driving the family car the next day, driving us to my dad  
again. It was just dropped. The irony in, I mean, not just irony, but good.  
I mean, she fouled for one, but let me ask you, let me ask you this night at this time in your life.  
And when I'm saying at this time, I mean right now, what is your relationship like with death? I  
never thought about it, but I really honestly feel like that I haven't thought about it because at  
some point in my life, after my dad died, I started counting on my hand of how many more  
people that's close to me could leave in and affect me. And it really, really wasn't very many.  
So I, I never really thought about it. Okay. So you've never really thought about what your  
relationship is with death, which is understandable.  
You haven't had that many people around you that as you stated could affect you, their death  
would affect your feelings or emotions in life. So I guess now I have a follow-up question fromthat. What is the sensitive side underneath your shell? And what does that version of Lynette  
want to accomplish? Because you, the hard side, we all know, we see it, we know it, we  
recognize it.  
The personality that bubbles out from it is amazing. It's an attention grabber. It's, it's a person  
that when you come in the room that you, you command that attention.  
But what does outside of that and underneath that, what does that version of Lynette want?  
Because believe it or not, we all have two versions. We have the version that we show  
everybody. And we have the version that we show the people that are closest to us.  
And sometimes we show a lot of it. Sometimes we want to show a little bit of it, but it's human  
nature from time to time to be able to put on it. And for those that go to work every day, it's a  
prime example from time to time, but the person that you show them at work versus the  
person that you are at home.  
So what I want to know is outside of group homes for newbies, that Lynette that we all know,  
obviously we're getting a lot of your backstory here tonight to understand where you came  
from and where you and how you got to where you are right now. But there is so many more  
layers underneath that top layer that we all see. And now we're learning how that, how those  
layers are woven based upon the story, your story that you're telling us right now, but  
underneath that top layer, who is that version of Lynette and how often can we see her? So just  
to fast forward on the timeline for time, um, of course the guy that I was dating, that didn't  
work out.  
Um, I started dating after I started dating him, I was in a relationship with a woman for maybe  
10 years, 19 years, married her. Um, that marriage didn't work out. Um, I've been to jail twice,  
uh, throughout my twenties.  
I do want to go on record to say that I'm, I, I'm not a convicted felon. Um, I do talk about  
criminal records. I do talk about, ask questions for feelings, not because I'm one is because I  
know people who are, I'm trying to change their life over and I'll try to figure out what can be  
done for them.  
So I just want to fast forward a little bit, but I'm going to put all of this in a book so y'all can get  
intricate details. But that person, for me, um, I know you probably heard of like a soft gear soft  
girl era, um, where, you know, women don't have to be hard. You know, we can just, you know,  
let our hair down and be a woman.  
And so, uh, the person that I'm dating now has been able to bring that out of me. Um, and  
that's, that's what I like. That's what I want.  
Uh, hard being in a relationship for a while. And he, you know, he's been sticking beside me  
and you know, my ways or whatever. But I'm, you know, being able to open up to him and let  
him lead.And so I guess what my, my life under all of it would be just to be able to exhale, um, be a, you  
know, be a woman, be a lady, um, be with a, somebody that mirrors my daddy. Um, and not for  
me to have to be my daddy because he was a protector. He was the provider.  
Um, he could, you know, do any and everything. And so I do a lot. I have a lot of his ways, his  
mannerisms because I grew up, um, you know, with a man.  
And so I'm having to, I learned these masculine ways that I have in to be a woman. And so my  
idea is to just be able to have my person be able to be a woman, be able to be soft, be able to  
be vulnerable. Um, um, I think I have a, I would say, um, both of, I also, fast forward, I got  
pregnant again when I was 20 years old, had my son when I was 21\.  
Um, by the same guy, um, that I got kicked out for or whatever. But, um, we still have a real  
close relationship, but the relationship didn't work out. We are friends and he's very supportive,  
great co-parent.  
Um, but I had both of my children from people that I'm not with. And so I would like to be able  
to, you know, have a family with the person that I'm with, have a, uh, a child through marriage.  
You know, I just desire to have those things versus everything or, you know, having my child,  
my child, her dad has passed away.  
Um, second child wasn't expecting it. It wasn't a planned pregnancy. So I just kind of want to do  
things to where I could just be a lady, you know, um, still run my business, but have somebody  
that's leading me versus me being a leader.  
I'm tired of being a leader and the relationship, the relationships that I've been in, I hadn't been  
able to come out of that versus, you know, what I'm experiencing now. So that's up on the, all  
of the heart boarded. Net five years from now, what do you, what do you see yourself  
accomplishing? Five years from now, we'll put me at 36\.  
My daughter will be grown. Uh, my son will be 16, a teenager. Hopefully I have me another  
baby.  
Um, I want to be the stay at home wife and mom. Uh, just put my little pieces where it needs to  
be. Just focusing on relaxing a little bit.  
I want to be retired. Not that, not saying that I want to just put everything on a, my partner or  
my husband, but I want to finally be able to take up, take my hand off the wheel. I don't want  
to, I don't want to be on a wheel.  
I don't want, I don't want that job no more. I've been having it since I was 16\. Right.  
I do want to be financially financially stable, which means multimillionaire. Um, I want to every  
goal that I have lined up for myself, which are coming at me really, really fast. I'm learning new  
things all the time.People that follow me see that I posted my story, different ways to make money, just like ginger  
coming on today about the government contract. And that's something I want to get into. Um,  
even talk about IDD, my, um, my goal isn't to get an IDD contract, but I want to do adult mental  
health, um, basically in honor of my mom and dad, because both of them dealt with mental  
health issues.  
And that's kind of how I'm able to relate to the individuals in my, in my homes that struggle  
from mental health issues, because that's where I come from. Both of my parents come from  
that and I try to treat people how I want my mom or my dad being treated in the bid that they  
will still alive to health, you know, safe and affordable housing, um, with their illness. So I love  
my mental health population.  
So I want to do that. Um, I do want to go into real estate. It's just, you know, I just got so much  
right now this coming at me that I'm seeking, you know, interesting.  
And I can just only imagine as I continue to, uh, learn as I continue to network with other  
professionals, other people who are successful in various industries. I know that I'll, um,  
probably add to the things that I want to do, but I just don't want to do it hard. I don't want to  
do it.  
Um, alone. I want to continue to build my network. I want to continue to grow with my partner.  
Um, and so in five years from now, I just want to be a wife. Uh, uh, he had me, he had me a little  
toddler running around and we ain't got no worries. We leave the words to daddy.  
So here's something that Lynette doesn't know what she does cause I've mentioned it to her  
before. All right. But I don't know when typically I put a deadline on things, but I'm going  
through some trainings right now where I'm kind of leaving time to the side with some of the  
stuff that I'm learning.  
Um, but net did not mention, which I'm putting it out there for her. We will have a podcast. Her  
and I are going to be interviewing different people in the group home space and in other  
spaces around all of this to be able to continuously bring value back to the group and really  
cement group homes for newbies as the premier organization for group homes nationwide.  
And I like to put that stuff like that out on public forums because then it lights a fire under my  
ass to go get it done. Cause if I say, if I tell a hundred plus people that I've got it, that I'm gonna  
do it now, I gotta, I gotta start. Y'all can't see my podcast, but I gotta start putting it to use  
more, uh, and start changing some things around.  
But if you guys don't know, and by this time we're five hours plus in, if you haven't realized by  
now, the leader of this pack has walked the life that she has talked, has been through hell. I  
water, snow, sleep storms and everything in between. And while there were times of stumbling  
and even sometimes a falling every time she's gotten right back up.And when you see that type of tenacity in somebody, all you do is turn around and say, what  
can I do for you? Because Ned is going places guys. I'm not really a social media person. I really  
don't care about social media.  
I was off Facebook for years before getting back on. And I didn't get, I didn't want to get back  
on when I got back on. It was a buddy of mine making me and net has inspired me with her  
postings and different things like that to be a little bit more active, make my voice a little bit  
more heard and provide my gifts that God has blessed me with to the world, just as she is  
doing here tonight and on a day to day basis.  
So I don't want anybody to sleep on what you're witnessing right here with the rising star that  
she is. And I loved your story. I know that there was more of it, but we got to save some for the  
book.  
You got to save some for the book. But what you just heard tonight was simply put tragedy,  
triumph, trauma, and then eventually triumphs. We all got a story.  
Every last one of us has a story. And. To feel like you don't just simply means that.  
You're still at a point right now that you have not fully overcome yet, and that's OK. OK, that's  
OK. But I want you to look back.  
And look at all of the things that you put a but after change it to an A. I grew up without a  
daddy and I still mean I grew up and my mama died. My mama died when I was three. And  
because of that.  
I am who I am today. Before the age of 19, I lost three or four important people in my life and.  
As a result of that, it's made me who I am today.  
There's a lot of people, there's friends, there's a lot of people attacking me. And as a result of  
that, I am going to make it. And go back and show them why they shouldn't have doubted me.  
I don't really get we have a dysfunctional family, and because of that, I now know exactly how I  
don't want to raise my family. My parents never taught me about credit and. I have an 800  
credit score because I knew that I didn't want to live Robin Peter to pay Paul because we  
couldn't go get credit anywhere.  
Your story hasn't ended out of but. I can't say one thing in charge and do nothing else. He kept  
him an 800 credit score.  
He talked to us about our finances. I was able to cosign on me and my brother first car. So we  
didn't he we was, you know, in a struggle a little bit.  
But when it came to making sure we had our stuff in order, managing our money, having our  
rainy day savings account, all of this. So Charles admits to me. So when I say he was a man that  
raised us, taught us, you know, told us how his world really is, you know, none of that.So I have, you know, hundreds of stories about, you know, how awesome I did it was. It was  
less than a year that I experienced the. Version of him, the others probably knew him to be, but  
he was able to, like I say, straighten up for his children, teach us right from wrong.  
We respected anybody that was an adult. One of his cousin who I went to visit, she's 72 years  
old. And she told me just off of my text message to her.  
She knew that I was, you know, well-mannered, very respectful just off of my yes, ma'am, no,  
ma'am, through my text message, because my dad didn't play that. Anybody that was a folk, we  
had to put them on me. And any folk that wanted to correct us could be able to correct us.  
We really did grow up with a village. So, like, you know, I ended up in the store with my daddy,  
you know, with his relapse. But that was only maybe six months of the 19 years I known him.  
And he was truly an amazing man. And he have been and always been and always will be my  
inspiration. And he set the bar extremely high for anybody that come into my life.  
I know what I need to be looking for. I know what love is. I know how I should be treated.  
And so I did want to make sure that, you know, Charles is up here, regardless of whatever he  
went through. He was still an amazing father, amazing grandfather. So I wanted to leave it at  
that.  
You know what, Nett, opposition for an overcomer is just an opportunity. That's it. Your dad.  
Laid a great foundation for you. You've taken it up. And started off on a rocky road.  
But it's paved smooth now. Yes, indeed. And just, you know, his voice rings.  
He has been ringing. We had 24, so this year he'll make 12 years. My dad had been gone.  
And even though he's not here with me in the flesh, I can still hear his voice because he talked  
to us. If any situation arises, I know what my daddy would do. I know what my daddy would say  
because he talked to us.  
And one thing that he would always say is he was like, I don't benefit from telling you anything  
wrong. I don't get nothing out of telling you anything wrong. So if I'm telling you, you know, I'm  
telling you for your own good.  
And so he he told us a lot. And so I do appreciate being able to help him, because even though,  
like I say, he's gone, my mom's gone, my grandparents have gone. I still have.  
The upbringing from my grandma and my daddy is so I can hear his voice on a daily basis, I can  
hear my grandmother's voice. And so I know what to do, even when I feel like I'm alone, even  
though I feel like I need to, you know, at times I feel like I want to leave. You know, I wish my  
daddy was here.All I can say is like, damn, you know, what would my daddy say? And it'll come to me. What  
would my grandmama say? It'll come to me. So I still have him.  
And that's just like one of the greatest, greatest gifts of all. He's still here with me. My both of  
my grandparents, my granddad's were already deceased before I was born.  
So that's why I don't have any stories about my grandfathers. But yeah, my daddy was he was  
so mean. He was he was true.  
So I just want to put that out there. Can't nobody tell me nothing about Charles. Nothing.  
I want to even though I want to hear the stories, I know him for who he was to me and my  
sister. So that'll never change anything. Hey, we're going we're going to write a book called  
Look What Charles Did.  
Yeah, it's going to be all about your life. Yes. Again, for the 163 people that are still on here  
right now.  
Thank you guys for staying on this marathon of a story with us. It was worth every second. And  
thank you guys for making a commitment to yourself to say, hey, I want to learn more about  
her.  
And in turn, probably pick up a few things that have helped me learn more about me. I'm going  
to say this again. I'm a huge, huge, huge believer in therapy.  
I've been through a lot of therapy. I have life coaches. I have a lot of different coaches in my life.  
But. With everything that's been uncovered here tonight, if you are experiencing trauma and  
you're not the person that you can be because you're still being held back by trauma. I  
encourage you find somebody find some type of licensed professional.  
It ain't a stigma to go sit on the couch. Hey. These people are not judging you.  
They're not family. Family going to judge you because you can tell them your problems and  
they'd be like, oh, I went through that myself. I look, I. Go sit with somebody that's unbiased,  
that doesn't know, doesn't have a preconceived notion about your life and the things that  
you've been through and get some of this stuff out.  
Going through trauma release therapy was one of the best things I've ever done in my life. It  
released ego out of my life completely. It allowed me to understand what my ego make me  
aware of when my ego is speaking versus when my spirit is talking.  
And the amount of peace that I have in my life right now is tremendous because I'm not  
bearing that weight anymore. And there was a lot. I mean, a lot.  
A lot. But again, net. Thank you to everybody that stayed home.Thank you. And guys, just know that there are big things continuously being planned in the  
background for group homes for newbies and where we're going to take everything. And we  
got our fearless leader here to help us get that.  
Well, I want to tell you, thank you as well for coming on with me tonight. I couldn't have picked  
a better person to come in to help me with my story. My sister even texted me saying I'm about  
to get done to be my therapist.  
I'm like a therapist. She said, well, you need to be one. I said, look, I have to connect y'all.  
But I really do appreciate you taking the time tonight. And as always, other nights when I, you  
know, lean on you for support and ask you to step in, you always do that. So I do want to thank  
you for that.  
And I'm looking forward to more sessions, you know, growing with you. It's always a good time  
when we're both in the room. Always, always.  
So if you're going to be in the room next Friday and Saturday, let me tell you something is  
going down. Yes, I'm coming out in unrare form. And about to turn that place out.  
So. All right. See y'all in Dallas.  
Y'all have a great night and more to come. All right. Good night, everybody.  
And I appreciate you all tuning in tonight. Thank you. Thank you.  
Thank you. Good night. Good night.  
Good night. Thank you. Good night, everyone.  
Good night. Thank you, Dunn. Lynette, you know, you my sister and I love you and I'm proud of  
you.  
You handled yourself very well. And I'm going to be gone. Thank you all so much.  
Well, I'll be sending you my insurance information so you can be my. This is a group counselor  
there.
