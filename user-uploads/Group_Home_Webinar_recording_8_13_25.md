Group Home Webinar recording 8:13:25  
Good evening, everyone. We're gonna get started here in a second. Type where you're from in  
the chat.  
Hey, how to get started with a group home in 45 days or less. My name is Lynette Wheaton. I  
am a seven-figure group home mentor.  
I have, of course, my group home business, my non-medical home care agency, and I'm also a  
mentor to thousands of people across the country. All right, so here's some community news. If  
you want to, you can take a screenshot of this slide.  
If you're looking to open up a youth group home, text interested to this number and I'll send  
you the link. If you need business funding or help with your personal credit, text credit to the  
same number. If you're in the Atlanta or Houston area and you want to do door-knocking, you  
will send an email over to that email.  
And before I move on, I'm going to let my partner, Dion Lewis, tell you about door-knocking.  
Hold on, let me unmute him. Okay, Dion, you should be good.  
Hey, Lynette. Hey. I lost it.  
Hold on. Oh, all right. How's everybody doing tonight? So, me and my business partner, McKell,  
we actually run multiple real estate companies.  
We have a wholesale company also in which we actually reach out to people who are in pre-  
foreclosure. Primarily, we're to bring on and help train people who may potentially be  
interested in door-knocking in the Atlanta area and the Houston area. Essentially, what door-  
knocking is, is we reach out to homeowners who are actually going through pre-foreclosure.  
We let them know that they do have options to stop the sale. Some of the options are for them  
to keep the house. Some of the options are if they would like to sell the house.  
And if we are able to purchase the house or wholesale the house, whoever knocked the door  
and set the appointment for our team would actually get 20% of the deal. So, if we make  
$10,000, you get two. If we make 20, you get both and things of that nature right there.  
So, anybody who may potentially be interested in doing some door-knocking in the Houston  
and the Atlanta area, please feel free to reach out to me. For those who already have, on  
Thursday, I'll be doing initial training with y'all. So, if you did not receive an invite, just reach out  
to me on Facebook or utilize the email.  
Thanks, Lucis. Appreciate you. Okay.  
So, next thing, Mikel, you should be able to unmute right now. Mikel, are you here? Yes, I am.Okay.  
Can you give them information about the meet-up we're having in Miami? So, last month, we  
did a meet-up here in Atlanta. And I think people that came today were absolutely amazing.  
And in that meet-up, what we do, what we try to do is so, for us, it's just not a meet-up in a  
traditional sense.  
Our meet-ups are more along the line of educational opportunity. I like to call it a opportunity,  
a mini-conference somewhat, because what we do is that we're trying to bring two things we're  
trying to do. One is that when we go from city to city, what we are noticing is that, and prior to  
us getting to the city, we're hearing that a lot of people in this group home space or in this  
group home community, group homes for newbies, are not collaborating with one another.  
There's a lot of people in cities that don't even know each other. So, these group homes meet-  
ups are to actually spark the meet-ups. And with which we hope that someone would take up  
the torch after we leave from the meet-up.  
So, what we try to do is bring someone that has already been on the conference tour, even if it's  
not Lynette, someone else that has been on a conference tour, giving valuable information. So,  
it is a learning opportunity. It's a connecting opportunity.  
But it's also an opportunity for you guys to start collaborating with one another in your city. So,  
what we're doing is that our next stop is Miami. And Miami, we say Miami, but it's for the entire  
Florida and for anyone else in the nation that would like to come.  
So, this will be a meet-up where I think this one will kind of be like the grand finale of Lynette's  
tour, right? So, there will be a lot of speakers that were already on the conference tour this year  
that will be in Miami as we close out the tour for Lynette for this year. So, this is an opportunity  
for everyone to come in and meet people that have been experts in the group home space,  
experts in the care home space, care agency space. So, there will be a lot of people in Miami for  
this one because, as I said, there's going to be a lot of people on Lynette that have come from  
the tour stops that Lynette has done, the 10-city tour stops throughout the country.  
So, again, we will be doing a five-city stop period throughout the country. We haven't named all  
five of the cities yet, but Miami is definitely our first one. But again, we hope with these that  
each state will start hosting and each city in the state will start hosting their own group homes  
for newbies for you guys to collaborate with one another and work more closely to help each  
other start and scale your business.  
All right. Thank you, Mikael. Yeah.  
All right. And so, in September, midway through August, beginning of September, I will be  
starting a virtual office where essentially, I will be having people come into my office in different  
rooms virtually to watch you cold call. So, basically, you'll have to have your cameras on.I have to see you smiling and dialing to help you basically hold you accountable to making sure  
that you will be pushing out your cold calls to various referral partners in your community. I'll  
also be able to use this time to help you perfect your calls while you are calling and getting  
people on the phone. And it's also an opportunity for other people to also be able to join in and  
listen to how those calls go and how I'll be able to critique them.  
Also, in the virtual office, I will also be scheduling days for the office for you to send out your  
literature. So, basically, when you're sending out your emails weekly, going over what you  
should be sending out, how often you should be sending them out, as long as you're inside of  
the virtual office, you will be working. So, this is helping you with accountability, helping you  
structure your emails, giving you ideas to send out because I don't teach my students to do the  
same boring emails over and over.  
I don't teach my students to use the same dry flyer sending over your literature over and over.  
We like to be creative with our emails. We like to be creative with our subject line because we  
have to get these people to actually open what we send them.  
So, if you are interested in being in my virtual office to be notified, you can text virtual to 346-  
600-9626. And any questions about my products or services, you can also text me at that  
number as well. All right.  
So, what you will learn tonight, I will be going over tips on how to start a group home with no  
license or grant, how to find people to move in without having any experience, going over my  
complete blueprint to go from zero to anywhere between $4,000 to $7,000 a month off of one  
house, and how to get started in the next 45 days. Who am I? My name is Lynette Wheaton. I've  
built seven non-medical, aka unlicensed group homes in the Houston metro area.  
I have other people launch their group homes. I've been doing it since 2022\. I have a  
community of over 74,000 people across the country.  
It's inside of Group Homes for Newbies where you'll see the real receipts, real results, and real  
impact. How I got started. So, I was a correctional officer watching people get released with  
nowhere to go.  
And I say watching them get released, but there were actually a lot of them who had made  
parole, received their parole certificate, but they weren't getting released because they didn't  
have an address. And then there were others who actually discharged their sentence, or they  
maxed out their sentence, depending on what state you're in. It's called different things, but  
basically completed their incarceration.  
And they weren't happy about going home because they didn't have an address. They had  
broken bonds with family. Some of their family members had passed and gone.  
And so, after doing 20, 30 years in prison, you know, the world was just not the same. I'm 32  
years old, and I've seen things shift drastically just out of my three decades that I've had tolearn to navigate with time. So, imagine somebody being incarcerated for decades, having to  
jump out in society where things have changed, and people that they once knew has moved on  
with life.  
So, there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm about going home because of not having an address to  
parole to. That's the main thing, or just the address to release to. And then you just have to  
understand, as people in the free world, we know that most traditional ways of getting a house,  
getting an apartment, or just having a place to stay, we all face barriers of background checks,  
checking that box, having to make sure that we look good on paper, whether it's creditor or our  
background.  
And so, we can 100% say that people who are returning citizens will automatically be  
disqualified if they ran a background check, especially if there's no cap on the crime. So, with  
me knowing these things and witnessing firsthand what these men and women were getting  
ready to experience, I wanted to provide a solution for those individuals. And that's what my  
thought was when I started opening these group homes, was housing people who were  
returning home from prison.  
And even though I house people who are returning home from prison, there are many people  
that's in the community that I also service. So, I want you to keep that in mind. For those of you  
who are looking to house people who are returning home from prison, understand that there is  
a window where people have to take time to get their benefits back started.  
But you could be in a state where they have money available for people to get on their feet.  
Whether it's the first month up to six months, I've seen different states do different things. So,  
there are states that actually have a reentry program where they fund housing until people get  
their affairs in order.  
And so, when I got started, I had a four-bedroom house. I had three empty bedrooms upstairs  
because I sent my kids to Mississippi for the summer. And I had a light bulb moment.  
I wanted to provide housing for people in my own home because the rooms were just empty.  
So, June and July of 2021, I was able to bring in people from the Department of Criminal Justice  
here in the state of Texas, as well as people that was in the community. I had six people in my  
house, two per room.  
And this is essentially how I got started housing people who were returning home from prison.  
And at that time, I was charging them $650 a bed. So, each room, I got $1,300 a room.  
And for those two months, I was able to save the money to get my very first rental property.  
And also, I want to note that when I got started, so I want you all to understand from my  
background, I don't come from a background of wealth. I don't come from a background with a  
lot of people who are entrepreneurs.  
I don't come from a background of knowing anything about the healthcare space or real estate.I was just a correctional officer that saw a problem and wanted to offer a solution. With that  
being said, at the time I started my business, it was during the heart of COVID.  
It was in 2021\. I had my mortgage on deferred payments. I had my car note in forbearance.  
My house note was in forbearance. My car note was deferred. And so, basically, I was able to  
save my money all of June and July and get my very first group home.  
And so, my twin sister is on this call. People may ask, has always asked me, how was I able to  
get a landlord to allow me to use their home to get started? So, August of 2021, my sister was  
able to allow me to put my very first group home in her name because I did not have check  
stubs. I did not have bank accounts supporting the income that I was making.  
I did, of course, generate income in my personal home, but at that time, I wasn't running my  
business as a business. The money that I was getting, I was just pocketing. I didn't even have a  
business bank account at the time because when I got started, remember, I wasn't thinking  
about starting a business.  
I was just thinking about solving a problem for people who were returning home from prison. I  
did not have any understanding of starting an actual business and having a business bank  
account and all the layers that you need to build out your foundation when you're getting  
started. So, my very first home, August of 2021, my sister ended up allowing me to get it in her  
name.  
I still have that home to this day. This is my fourth year with that home and I have seven others.  
Put some fires in the chat for my twin sister for believing in me and allowing me to use her  
name to get started on my group home journey because you all have to realize that you need a  
tribe when you get started.  
You may not have everything that you need to make your dreams come true, but you need to  
be around people who actually see your vision. You need to be around people who understand  
you're going to need support. If you got people around you that will not support your dreams,  
you need to re-evaluate your circle.  
You will learn that inside of Group Homes for Newbies, we've created a tribe where we help one  
another. We go into different partnerships. As you see what Will and Mikkel mentioned earlier,  
they met in Group Homes for Newbies.  
Mikkel came in as an investor for a property and a business that Will essentially wanted to do  
but needed support doing it. I do want to just highlight that you need to make sure that you  
have people around you that's going to be supportive of you when you're getting started. You  
may not have everything that you need, but that's why you should be able to lean on other  
people to help you get the job done.  
Had it not been for my sister allowing me to use her name, I don't think that I would have beenable to get this far because most times people put their name on something that's real serious.  
Especially in a Black community, they teach us not to cosign for nothing, don't put our name on  
nothing. But fortunately for me, I grew up in a household where my dad raised us to make sure  
that we looked out for one another.  
That's how I got started. I'm going to move along. What most people believe, they feel like you  
need a license to start.  
They feel like you need a lot of money. They think it takes anywhere between 6 to 12 months to  
start seeing income. They think you need health care experience or you need to own real  
estate.  
You'll see throughout my PowerPoint, I got different clips of my resident because I want to also  
be able to allow you to paint a picture of people who live in an unlicensed home. You can see  
that he is missing both of his legs, but he's able to be in an unlicensed home and do for himself.  
Don't think that just because someone is disabled, they're not able to live independently or  
semi-independently with the help of other resources in the community.  
The truth is, you do not need a license to begin. Most times people turn to their state's website,  
usually the Health and Human Services website, where it says something along the lines of  
three or more or four or more unrelated individuals needing help with their personal care  
services or any type of care services. I don't care what state you're in, your state law is going to  
say a licensed home's requirement is three or more or four or more unrelated individuals  
basically needing help performing any type of care.  
And so how we use that gray area is because in the unlicensed homes, we don't provide any  
care to these individuals. Only thing we can do, if you want to look at it as if we're being a  
traditional landlord, but allowing multiple people to occupy the home, essentially that's what  
we are doing. Because with the unlicensed home, we use third-party organizations to come in  
and fill the gaps where any type of health care needs, any type of health concerns, whether it's  
a personal care test, if they need skilled services, up to even hospital care.  
We use third-party organizations to come in to fill those gaps. So this is the cheat code, right?  
Understand this, with a licensed home, a licensed home is able to provide care directly. So  
those individuals are performing tasks to the individuals in the home directly.  
Therefore, they need a license. In an unlicensed home, we are not providing any type of care or  
services directly. We are providing it indirectly by way of third-party organizations such as home  
care, home health care, hospice, a pharmacy that delivers, having a nurse practitioner come in,  
having a psychiatrist come in.  
We are having people with independent agencies and practice come into the home and provide  
those services. So that's how you get away from being licensed. Now, I can say that anybody  
that's in an unlicensed home must be able to ambulate, whether it's with a wheelchair, walker,a rollator, or with their two feet.  
Nobody can be total care individuals in an unlicensed home, whether it's due to their mobility  
or to their cognitive ability. So they have to be what we call a walkie-talkie, able to maneuver,  
and able to self-evacuate without assistance from anyone in the home, and they are in their  
right mind. So I just want to make sure that we're clear on why we are not required to have a  
license when operating this business because we do not provide any care.  
We just provide the housing and third-party organizations is who we partner with to come into  
the home to provide the services that's needed. You can lease a home to start, so you do not  
have to go out and purchase a home to get started in this business. You can lease a home, what  
we call rental arbitrage.  
We connect with real estate investors and different landlords to ask them to allow us to use  
their property to get started with our business. And again, like Will mentioned earlier, we do  
not be misleading when it comes to people allowing us to use their property. We want to let  
them know the intent with our group home business.  
You can also fill your home in 30 days. You will do this by way of making sure you do a market  
analysis, figuring out who all in your area that's needing your services, so when time comes for  
you to launch, you know exactly where you will be getting your people from. And it also helps  
you understand the need in your community.  
And of course, you can launch this without a medical background or a degree. When I got  
started with this business, I didn't know the first thing about healthcare. All I had was a high  
school diploma, so it doesn't require you to have any experience to get started.  
So you don't need a license to start. Learn how to operate legally, how to serve the underserved  
demographics, and avoid red tape and delays. I do want to make sure that even though I talk  
about the underserved demographic, there are some demographics out here that's not  
technically considered underserved that also need safe, clean, and affordable housing options  
as well.  
But for the sake of this webinar tonight, I'm only talking about the underserved demographic.  
There's several different populations that, like I said, fit this business model, so don't just think  
that you have to go out targeting people who are underserved because there's a host of people  
who need your business. I received all three of these individuals came from Texas Department  
of Criminal Justice.  
So basically, all three of them are returning citizens. As you can see, two of them are missing  
one leg, and this one guy here, he has Parkinson's. And two of the three so happen to be  
individuals who have a sex-related charge.  
So I also have people who have sex-related charges, are better known as sex offenders. So  
think about this. Where others see broken systems, you see opportunity.So what I mean by that is, with the broken systems, how I talked about the background check,  
how I talked about the credit check, most people who are in traditional settings want people to  
check out certain boxes to be able to live in their homes. You may not know it or not, but even  
people who are trying to get mortgages, there are some untraditional ways to be able to get  
into real estate and purchase your home, but a lot of people who are returning home from  
prison only know of the traditional ways. And most of those times, even if they get out and get  
a job and are able to get a mortgage, a lot of lenders will not lend to people who are still on  
parole due to the risk of them violating their parole, going back to prison, and the mortgage  
lenders have to figure out how to foreclose and sell that property again.  
So these people face a lot of barriers, and so how we make our money is basically providing an  
opportunity where other people close the door on their face. And so where you see numbers, I  
see clients for group homes. All right, so let's do some numbers real quick, because I'm not  
going to do all the work tonight.  
I'm going to make y'all work a little bit too. So this is what I want you to do. So hopefully those  
of you that's not on your phone or have a second device that you can use, I want you to xChat  
GPT.  
How many people in your city or your state, whichever you want to use, receive SSI? Don't put  
SSDI, just put SSI. So for instance, if it was me, I would say to chat GPT or Google, how many  
people in the state of Texas receive SSI? And when you get that number, put it in the chat. While  
y'all are putting it in the chat, I'm going to tell you exactly what SSI is.  
SSI is Supplemental Security Income, or it may say Supplemental Security Insurance. These are  
individuals, as long as they are in the state, if they are in the U.S., in the United States, they are  
able to receive SSI if they are aged. Age is 65 years and older.  
If they have a disability, whether it's a medical condition, a mental condition, or a physical  
condition. And if they are blind, the rating has to be 20 over 200\. Now again, we talked a little  
bit earlier about that disabled piece.  
Even though in the U.S., you can get SSI if you're disabled. Some illnesses are quicker than  
others. If it's a terminal illness, you get it faster.  
If it's not a terminal illness, it takes anywhere from six months to a year to get that. So I want  
you to notate that. So as you all can see the different numbers in the chat, these are people  
who got guaranteed income in your state on your own time.  
You can narrow it down to your city so you can see how many people get guaranteed income in  
your city. And I want you to note that most people across the country receive $967. That is what  
SSI is.  
It goes up about 2.5% each year for a cost of living adjustment. Each year it goes up. There are  
about six different states who get more than $967 because the federal government pays the$967 and then some states that where they have cost of living that is extremely high also give  
them a supplement of security income.  
So some of those states have anywhere between $1,200 to $1,400 worth of SSI. Now the next  
question I want you to extract GPT is how many people in your state is homeless but receiving  
benefits? Type that in. How many people in the state of is homeless but receive benefits? Let me  
see what those numbers are.  
Y'all ain't quick on your feet. So the reason why these numbers are important is because these  
are people who are homeless that have guaranteed income right there in your area. And just so  
you'll know, because you may wonder if this information is accurate or how they obtain this  
kind of information, different homeless shelters do an account.  
And part of the questions that they ask them is do they receive income? That data has to be  
submitted. Especially with non-profit organizations that's receiving funding from the city or  
from the state or from the federal government, they are tracking numbers. Also there's a  
software, well it's kind of like a satellite.  
It's like a one night snapshot of people experiencing homeless. It's called a pick count. And  
there are some cities where our cities once a year, some are quarterly, they send out people to  
actually physically count people who are homeless across the city.  
So I want you to see the numbers in your area when you are gauging people who will need  
safe, clean, and affordable housing. And also understand that just because somebody is  
homeless, that don't mean that they're incomeless. People are homeless.  
Some of them have money, but they don't have affordable options in their area. Because again,  
I told you, SSI is $967. Most apartments are going to want you to produce three times the rent.  
That's not going to fly. And you may say, well, what about low income apartments? Or what  
about senior housing? Again, those different programs are not designed for people who have a  
criminal background. They are eliminators.  
They are eliminators. So another thing I want you to put or X-Check GPT or whatever software  
you're using is how many people return home from prison each year in your state? How many  
people return home from prison in your state? Thank you all for those who are actually  
participating in the call. Seeing is believing.  
Knowing what's going on in your area is going to help you fill your beds up. Data is what's  
going to help you fill your beds up. If you just sit back on the sideline being lazy, it's not going  
to work out for you.  
Because whenever you feel a low point in your business and you feel like it's dried up, but the  
data is saying there's thousands of people that need you, you're going to feel a little bit more  
motivated to go and find the people in your area that need your assistance. So thank you forthose who are participating. And one last statistic that I want you to look into is one of the main  
people or one of the main titles that you're going to need when you get started in this business  
is a social worker.  
So I want you to also ask how many social workers are in my state? See how many licensed  
social workers are in your state. The number is going to be accurate because anybody with a  
social worker degree and a license is going to be able to pull that data from the licensing board.  
It's going to pull the data.  
So I see 31,000. I see 39, 32, 27, 78, 31, 39, 10\. It's your job as business owners, group home  
operators to make connections with these individuals.  
Most times you may hear titles of case managers or discharge planners, but most of them also  
carry the degree of being a social worker. So if you know that people who are a social worker  
are the people you need to make connections with that deals with people who need a place to  
stay, then you got a ballpark number of when you come into my virtual office, how many  
people that need to be on your spreadsheet? How many people that need to be on your  
spreadsheet? And I'm going to drop a gem just because I got so many people participate in the  
activity. For those of you that don't participate, just mute this part.  
I only want to deal with the people that participate. Type in medicare.gov on your phone. Type  
in medicare.gov. I'm gonna give y'all time to type that in.  
Type in medicare. This is a gem. And again, for those of you that's not participating, this ain't  
for you.  
I see one done. I guess y'all getting ready. You not typing it.  
Go to find providers. We work in group homes for newbies. If you sit on the sideline, I don't  
know what to tell you.  
I don't know what to tell you. Find care providers. Go on medicare.gov and go to find care  
providers.  
All right, so when you get to find care providers, you're going to see provider types. Type it. You  
see doctors and clinicians, hospitals, nursing homes, home health services, hospice care,  
inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-term care hospitals, dialysis facilities.  
These are the people who are registered with medicare.gov. Keep in mind, not every need from  
a facility actually is credentialed with medicare.gov. So this ain't the gold mine. This is just a  
good part of it. So now I want you to hit hospitals.  
And so it's going to ask you for your zip code. Put the zip code in. If you got a view to where it  
allows you to adjust the mile radius, I like to teach my students from a 50-mile radius.  
If you're not where you can see a 50-mile radius, then it's okay. Type in your zip code and thenhit search. So we're going on hospitals.  
Hit search. I want to know how many hospitals are in your area. Drop it in the chat.  
I'm about to be counting. I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Come on, put them  
in.  
I need my participants working because I'm not going to do all this work for y'all. So for a  
shortcut, you go through each one of these options. The hospitals, the nursing homes, the  
inpatient rehab, the dialysis clinic, the home health, whatever on there, you go through there  
and you start your spreadsheet by collecting data off of there so you can start your cold calls.  
Thank you all for participating in this exercise. You're going to be successful. The ones that  
didn't, I'm going to send you my booking link because you're going to need me to help you  
because you're not an action taker.  
So that's just one gem. Let's keep on going. You can fill your beds without being a professional  
marketer.  
So you'll be able to use my referral strategies with social workers. You'll have access to my  
contacts, scripts, and directory methods, which I just gave you one of my directory methods,  
but I have about four. Keep that in mind.  
So when I tell you all that I grew my business to a half a million dollars in less than four years,  
and I have 48 beds and I keep them filled, understand that when it comes to pulling data and  
making connections, I'm the girl. And I'm going to also be able to show you how to build a  
waiting list before your doors open. So the right systems get you anywhere between $4,000 to  
$7,000 a month off of one house, that's net profit.  
So you're going to need your day-to-day operations. So your daily home routines, you're going  
to need house manager systems, whether you call it a house manager or a house lead, you're  
going to need to make sure that you have that in place. And then of course, you're going to  
need your policies and procedures, your SOPs and checklists for success.  
Harold is one of my house managers and he actually is what I would consider my field  
manager. He goes to all of my houses to make sure that the other house managers are doing  
the tasks that they need to do on a day-to-day basis. So house managers come in all shapes and  
sizes.  
Don't think that people who are disabled are not able to lead. So you have three choices. You  
can keep watching others win.  
You can try to figure it out on your own. Yeah. Or follow a proven systems that work.  
And so you have the ability to change lives. So this is my very first resident. As y'all can see on  
the left picture, he was malnourished.He had just came home from prison and the table that he's sitting in, that was my personal  
house. He was first person that I brought home to me and that's his improvement to the right.  
Well, it wasn't that much longer where he was able to start gaining weight, getting some  
mental health services in place.  
And I had him for about two years. And you may say, well, Lynette, he don't look like he's 65  
years and older and he don't look like he met 40 quarters. So how you bring him home? Let me  
tell you, long story short, when I got started with this business, I did not have a mentor.  
I didn't have a coach. I didn't have people telling me certain things for me to be able to avoid  
putting myself in situations where I'm having to take care of people out of my pocket until they  
start getting a benefit. So this is the prime example of why you need to make sure you follow  
my blueprint when it comes to helping people who are returning citizens.  
Because even though he was receiving SSI before he went to prison, because he had alcohol  
fetus syndrome and he was on SSI before he went to prison, when he got home from prison, I  
had to start that process all the way over. And so he stayed with me for a little over one year  
before I was receiving income from him. Now, when I did start receiving income, I did get back  
paid for the year that I took care of him, but that's not the goal.  
Simply because had he left at any point or had he started receiving his income and moved out  
to where I couldn't get my back paid, those things are risks that you take. Because when it  
comes to Supplemental Security Insurance, they don't pay you a lump sum of money up front  
for that year. They pay you in six months increments.  
So of course you get your monthly fee, but they pay I think up to $3,200 every six months when  
it's back pay. So I had to keep him another year, another two years to even get all of my back  
pay. Y'all, that is a gamble.  
That is a gamble. There are people right now under your nose who need safe, clean and  
affordable housing and actually have income to be able to pay you. Mr. James, I just want you  
to just tell your story.  
I can't remember. Yeah. I met you down on where a piano player, Will Fargo's and you asked  
me how I was doing and I told you that I was homeless and that's how it went.  
Yeah. What did you pray for? I prayed that I would find housing and here I am. I need to find  
you.  
I think you found me. For sure. Okay.  
And also, did you know that boarding homes existed? Yes and no. Because back from where I'm  
from, the boarding homes are set up differently. A lot of them have like rent payees where they  
get your checks and stuff like that.I don't think you do that. No, I only become the rent payee if people are incoherent and they  
aren't able to process what funds are. So basically, a severe intellectual disability or a mental  
illness or some type of memory issues.  
Okay. I'll be your payee unless you don't qualify for this, so no. So I created a three-part system,  
not just for me, but for others to follow.  
It's the net effect powered by the rent room strategy. Learn how to turn my spare rooms into  
consistent cash flow and how you can too. So here's the breakdown of my strategy.  
So you'll be able to get leads that hit. So basically, you'll be able to connect with referral sources  
in your community that most people overlook. See how to be able to set up your rooms in your  
homes to make sure that it's comfortable for the individuals that's living there, as well as the  
landlord pitch.  
Making sure your business is able to operate without you by using onboarding documents,  
getting your back office together, and setting up your day-to-day operations. So number one,  
you'll be able to connect with, and these are people that some of many other people that you'll  
connect with that will keep your beds filled. So you have county social services department,  
different nonprofit housing organizations, veteran assistance program, re-entry organizations  
for formerly incarcerated individuals, mental health and substance abuse treatment centers,  
and then of course, the social workers, discharge planners, and case managers.  
And what I also want to note is, write this down. So many of you may be in areas where people  
may be experiencing different hardships, whether they are returning home from prison and  
have to wait that little time out to be able to get their benefits back together, or it could be  
somebody in the community that cannot pay their first month rent or deposit and things like  
that, to where they need assistance. You can go on a site called unitedway.org to find help in  
your area.  
If that's what it's going to say, find help in your area. And you will have it to where they need  
help with the deposit and first month rent. And you can also list yourself as a housing provider.  
So when people go on findhelp.org, I mean, when they go, that's another one, but when they  
go on United Way, they'll be able to find housing, affordable housing, and you can list your  
business as housing options in the area. So when they do call 2-1-1 in the area, your business  
can come up. And also for people that are in the community that come to you that need  
assistance with the deposit and first month rent, you'll be able to help them get what they need  
to be able to pay you while their benefits are pending.  
And most of these programs require to show proof that income is on the way. So you will just  
submit their award letter or you will submit a statement to them, letting them know, you know,  
that they all need assistance for that month and that you are not going to evict them and so  
forth and so on. So I do have a template on what I use for individuals in my area so that if Ineed to basically vouch for them, that they will still have stable housing.  
If they give them the deposit and first month rent, they'll be able to get that. And the last, Jim,  
you need to know is if there's someone who is experiencing, not experiencing, if there's  
someone in your area that is disabled, or they are what they call a vulnerable citizen, and they  
have misplaced their card or not able to pay, and they are a vulnerable citizen, you can reach  
out to Adult Protective Services as well. They have funding available to help pay people's rent if  
they are a vulnerable citizen.  
So here's a few screenshots of leads that I've gotten so that you can see that my leads come,  
whether it's text messages, emails. This was a non-profit organization that basically, as you can  
see, right, inmates in 12 different states. I was able to connect with this non-profit organization  
and basically reverse engineer their business model so that I, too, can write people in all 50  
states and let them know about my housing for those who are returning home from prison.  
And I don't do it directly. I do it by way of my VA. And then you see here, this guy, 73 years old,  
child sex offender, got out of these different illnesses.  
And also a Marine veteran with an honorable discharge. And so it's kind of highlight this a little  
bit. Of course, this person is 65 years and older, so I know they got guaranteed income.  
When it comes to people who have a sex-related charge, I make sure that they are medically  
disabled. So I really want them broke down as much as possible, especially with this charge.  
And with him being a veteran with an honorable discharge due to a lot of his illnesses, he's  
been able to get 100% VA disability, which is right under $4,000 a month for him.  
And he also received Social Security. So his income is right at $7,000 a month for a 73-year-old  
child sex offender. And then this is a screenshot.  
Of course, it's kind of blocked out, but you can see that this individual was able to pay $1,600 a  
month. Here's more screenshots. This is a different nonprofit organization reaching out to me  
about somebody from Journey of a Second Chance Ministry.  
This is a lead from Adult Protective Services. This is a lead from a hospital. So I cast a wide net  
and my leads come from all over.  
So I have referrals that come from various resources, whether they call me, text me, email me,  
send me letters in the mail, fax over a lead, or coming through my website. So the bread room  
strategy is how you get your phone ringing off the hook. So number two, homes that convert,  
my room setup game, and the landlord pitch.  
So you want to make sure that you have proper furniture that's both comfortable and durable.  
Because of course, you will have more people, especially if you're doing an adult home where  
you got multiple adults utilizing the furniture. So you want to make sure that it's durable.It's not a traditional family setting. Have storage solutions that give residents dignity and  
privacy. Safety equipment that meets all local requirements.  
Common area arrangements that foster community while preventing conflict. Maintenance  
systems that keeps the property in excellent condition. So I have developed what I call the plug  
and play system.  
And this is just a way for you to kind of capture in your mind a home that doesn't cost a lot of  
money to stage. All of this stuff was used furniture. It was either donated or bought at a really  
low price.  
So you can make a house cozy on a budget. So when you say, you know, you got a home that is  
clean for these individuals, it's going to be clean, it's going to be nice, but you don't have to  
break the bank while doing so. So these are three of my different homes.  
This home right here on the far right, I had to close that house because it was too far away.  
One of the mistakes that I made when I first got started was just getting my houses all over the  
city, thinking that, you know, I wanted to A, be around the city or B, just going with the first  
landlord to say, yes, no matter where it was, but I experienced a lot of burnout. So I closed that  
home and started opening all of my homes in the same zip code.  
So even though I have seven right now, I grew my business to eight homes that were all full  
and functionable, making your business operational and setting up the business and our  
onboarding documents. So I do want you all to kind of see what my general flyer looks like. And  
I change my flyers all of the time because it's very important for you to make sure that you're  
being creative in your business.  
You don't want to change like your brand colors. You want to keep your brand colors  
consistent, but you can keep up with current events. You can tailor your flyers to a specific  
demographic.  
And these are real true pictures of my homes. As you all can see, this room is showing three  
beds, but it really have four beds in that room because I have them based on the square  
footage of the room. So this entire room is 240 square foot.  
And so we give them 60 square feet per person in the bedroom. As you all can see, this decor  
came right out of Family Dollar. These beds were donated.  
These beds I got for free. And these two beds was actually in my personal home. I had picked  
up to put in my first group home.  
These beds was in my home. So you need systems in place. From setting up your business  
structure, creating your digital footprint, getting leads to the door, and managing residents  
within the home.I have created every document needed to pitch to landlords, scripts for you to call to your  
referral partners, whether you're cold calling or sending out your very first email or follow-up  
email. So when you combine the three components that we went over, the lead channels that  
hit, the homes that convert, and making your business operational, you will have the bedroom  
strategy. And this guy here, he's one of my first residents.  
He was in that video with the one leg that you all seen in the beginning. He was like my, maybe  
my, so my very first home, I had 11 beds in there. So I had six in my home.  
I was able to move them out of my home and put them in a very first home. So I had six people  
plus an additional five. And so he was one of the first people I got in my first group home that  
did not come from my house.  
And he passed away this year in February. So I had him from August of 2021 to February of  
2025\. So he was with me for the long haul.  
As you can see that he is a senior citizen. He came home from incarceration. Most of these  
individuals who are returning citizens and they are seniors, they don't have other options, y'all.  
Their parents been passed away, family members grew up without them, and unfortunately  
they're left hanging. So there's hundreds of people that's still incarcerated right now, not  
hundreds, thousands of people that's still incarcerated right now who got guaranteed income if  
someone allowed them to discharge to their house. So I want you to keep that in mind.  
As a matter of fact, let's check GPT right now. How many people in my state could make parole  
but don't have an address, therefore they're still incarcerated? I know that's kind of long, but  
how many people are still incarcerated in the state of whatever due to the fact that they don't  
have an address? Put that in check GPT. How many people are in the state of, let's just say for  
instance, how many people in the state of Texas are still incarcerated because they don't have  
an address to parole to? Let's see what those numbers are.  
And you can narrow it down even further to see of that number how many people are over the  
age of 65\. You can narrow it down because if it tells me that it's 300, 400, 500 people over the  
age of 65 still need an address, you think I ain't going to find them. I'm writing them firsthand.  
And you may say, well, Lynette, how the hell are you going to write them? I'm going to give y'all  
another gym. If you are enjoying this webinar so far, put some fires in the chat. I'm going to  
drop another gym.  
If you enjoyed it, how would you determine who is in your department of corrections that still  
needs the address to parole to due to the fact that the halfway houses are full and they just  
ain't got an address to parole to due to different barriers. How do you find that out? There's a  
thing called the Freedom of Information Act. You can write your HR department or the  
headquarters of your department of criminal justice requesting a list of men and women who  
has made parole but are currently incarcerated.That's it. That's the answer. Get the list.  
Get the list. I ain't get enough fires in the chat for that gym. I ain't get enough fires in the chat  
for that.  
And I, and I saved that for my page. But I want these people out of prison. So I need y'all to get  
them out.  
I need y'all to get them out. So that's why I told it to you. Write the department of corrections  
and ask them to send you a list of individuals who are still incarcerated in your state due to the  
Freedom of Information Act.  
They have to release the information. And so you may get a list of a thousand people and you  
be like, okay, well, and then I got this list. Now what to do? Well, the next thing you're going to  
do, you're going to write them.  
And you're going to write the ones that are 65 years and older, because you can do an inmate  
search on your department of corrections website, and it's going to tell you their birthday. It's  
going to tell you that. If they born before 1960, they need a list.  
If they born before 1960, you know, they got guaranteed income. Let me tell y'all something.  
When it comes to my business model, I know it from front to back, side to side.  
There's not a person walking God's green earth that can battle me on learning how to keep  
these beds filled. Because I'm the girl with the data. I don't do things the traditional way.  
I'm a very strategic, creative thinker. So I'm going to get to the bag now. If I don't do nothing  
else, but we're going to keep on going.  
Can you see yourself benefiting from the bread room framework? Put a yes in the chat. If you  
see yourself benefiting from the bread room framework, put a yes in the chat. No flip, real  
testimony.  
Shout out to Lynette Wheaton for showing me and hundreds of other people her unlicensed  
Groupon share living model that has allowed me to become a successful operator to the point  
that I was able to leave my 9 to 5 job. And not only that, this unlicensed Groupon model has  
allowed me to use it to facilitate me to get to my unlicensed youth Groupon that I am currently  
working on as we speak. So I just want to say, Lynette, appreciate you for this model.  
I did not even know this model existed until I met you. And when I seen you doing what you  
was doing, I'm like, oh yeah, this is a great way to get in to not only create generational wealth  
for myself and my family, but to impact those who are in need in the community. I'm Dee in  
Charlotte, North Carolina.  
I just want to let you know that if you have not already purchased your ticket to next conference  
Groupon for newbies, you are missing out. The gems that they drop are amazing. Like moneycannot afford it.  
Seriously. So if you haven't already purchased, if you haven't already purchased your ticket and  
there are no more slots available, then you need to contact her for consultation because she's  
the bomb.com. Thank you guys. Hi everybody.  
I'm Justin. I'm from Milwaukee. I came all the way here to Charlotte to learn from the Groupon  
for newbies conference.  
It was fantastic. There was so much learning over the last two days. My fingers are sore from  
trying to type out all the notes on my laptop.  
I had voice recorder going. It was raining gold nuggets everywhere. So I definitely got a lot of  
information to change my business with and key things that I've been wanting to do with it.  
And you only have the same thing too. So there's probably very limited seats left at the  
remaining conferences and you can get signed up for them if you're at all serious about this  
conference. Thank you.  
The net effect, launch your very first Groupon in 45 days without owning the property, without  
getting licensed or guessing what to do next. So here's what you'll get. So you'll get my core  
training of my step-by-step videos valued at $19.97. My bread room lead scripts valued at $4.97.  
The house setup guide valued at $2.97. My onboarding templates valued at $4.97. The landlord  
goldmine bonus valued at $4.97. And my 30-day game plan bonus valued at $2.97. As far as  
today, only $9.97. You can start for as little as $65 a month with my buy now and pay later  
options through Klarna or Afterpay.  
And so I make sure that when people invest in my course, which is not a regular course, I know  
many of y'all have probably purchased courses in the past and it really didn't give you  
everything that you needed. My courses give you the meats and the potatoes and extra support  
from me. So I do have a money back guaranteed.  
If you do the work and it doesn't pay off, I'll refund you, but you got to show up and apply  
everything that I go over in my course and it's going to work out for you. And so again, with the  
bonuses, for those of you who are ready to act and build a business that makes money while  
making a difference, you will get my first 30-day action plan, a day-by-day checklist that tells  
you exactly what to do from the moment you join until your first residents move in. So it is a  
literally every single day.  
It's a 30-day from one to 30, something that you should be doing every day to mark off, to set  
your goals, to be able to bring your first resident to the door. All right. So second, you'll get my  
ebook on how to do a market analysis, how to find what's exactly needed in your area and how  
to find the people.  
So I gave you all for free, medicare.gov, for you to be able to pull different facilities in your areato reach out to them. But there are other ways to do the market analysis and to be able to  
connect with the referral partners in your area to be able to get your phone ringing off the  
hook. So this also going to be a bonus for those of you that sign up tonight.  
And then I have lifetime updates to all my materials. So as a business owner, we always make  
different modifications. We make revisions to our policies.  
We make revisions to our SOPs, just different systems that we have in place. Those things get  
modified to make sure that we are doing what's effective for our business. So when things  
come about, changes happen, new things are created.  
Business owners typically adopt change so that we can make sure that we continue to work on  
our business and not in our business. Because I don't believe in teaching anybody how to  
become self-employed. I teach you how to become group home operators or business owners.  
We're not going to be working in our business. And so systems are designed to replace us every  
single day. Oh, I'm so glad you woke up with your mind on me so you can put these desks  
together.  
I got two. No, I told you I was coming to get you today. Oh, I don't want to be with you.  
I got to take care of people. It's my off day too. I ain't doing shit but I need my thoughts like  
y'all.  
Y'all get lost, you get back. I'ma be my woman. I'm not doing nothing.  
My off day. I don't get no off day. My baby gotta help me get off day.  
I'm so glad she's back. Bonuses for action takers. So that's going to be additional $13.91 in  
value, but free for those who take action tonight.  
We know what? Say you want to go to the house? Yeah, you want to go to the house? I broke it  
to him. I would have bought the home. He was on the street.  
I'm not putting him back on the street. You just don't have to fight with me. I do.  
You mean tell your brother your hair is cut? Yeah. I had to send a picture. You see yourself? You  
look handsome.  
You glad you got your hair cut? Yeah. I'm gonna bring you a watch tomorrow. Oh, I miss my  
dog, man.  
You miss your dog? Yeah. We'll have to get you another one. Yeah, you just get me a dog right  
here, man.  
You need me to get you a dog over here? Yeah. Okay. Where's your dog, man? He come take  
care of him.I told you he was sick. Oh, man. I bet.  
Yeah, he's an old man. Mm-hmm. All right.  
And so, of course, I'm sure you all could determine that these are the same people. This is the  
day that I got him. Of course, he was homeless, living in a field.  
Adult Protective Services reached out to me to provide housing for him. It's been two years  
now. I got him September, I believe September of 2023\.  
This September will make two years where I've had him and he's been able to stay stable into a  
home. So, again, I was showing you different videos of different people that is suitable for an  
unlicensed home so that when you are out marketing and you are having different  
conversations, you can see that these individuals come in all shapes and sizes, but they are  
appropriate for the unlicensed model. And so, for today, you will be able to purchase my course  
for $9.97 with a money-back guarantee.  
So, at this time, I will post the link in the chat for those of you that want to sign up for the  
course. And we will take a few more questions tonight before we end the meeting. So, if you  
have any questions, you can raise your hand.  
Hey, Ms. Angela. Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, when the residents, when they pass, do  
you do all the funeral arrangements or their family or if they have family come in and take over  
and do that? If they have family, they take over.  
If not, the county will bury them. Oh, okay. Okay.  
County. All right. Okay.  
That's all I needed to know. Thank you. Hey, Ms. Krista.  
Hello. So, my question is regarding the ULDC. I have my home.  
Like, I pitched to a landlord. He agreed. Like, he knows that the house will be set up for a group  
home living situation.  
And I've got everything going. I've got applications coming in. I've been doing interviews.  
I'm ready to move people in. I was on the Group Home for Newbies site, and I saw where  
somebody else asked a question about permits. And I was like, oh, shoot, I didn't even think  
about that.  
And whoever answered the question talked about the ULDC. And so, I went today. It's in  
Baytown.  
I'm in Texas. And I went to the Baytown City Hall today and was told that group living is not  
permitted in that zoning district. Is there a way around it? Which county is that? Harris.Why didn't you go through Harris County? Because Baytown has a mayor. So, I had to go  
through the city of Baytown. When I looked it up online, it said I had to go through the city of  
Baytown planning and zoning.  
And so, when I went- Double check with the county. Okay. So far, what I've done is, because  
Baytown has a mayor, I've emailed the mayor to see if I could get a special use permit.  
But depending on what he says, you're saying I can go through Harris County? Most people  
from Baytown go through Harris County. Okay. Perfect.  
Thank you so much. Ms. Speed? Good afternoon. Hi.  
Hello. I know you said group home. Hello? Is it ILF? Yes.  
Because for ILF, you don't need to have any zoning permit. I just use group homes as an  
umbrella term, but I don't call my homes group homes. No.  
To the session, you've been saying group homes. Right. I just say that for just an umbrella term.  
I don't call it group home. It's just an umbrella term that I use. Okay.  
But for group home, we don't need any permit, any license to do that. Each state refers this  
home as something different. Oh, okay.  
But I'm just using group home as an umbrella term. Okay. I'm on Florida because I know we do  
ILF, not group home.  
If we don't say group home, we have to go under other regulation to do group home. Right. All  
right.  
Thank you so much. You're welcome. Ms. Family? Last name, family? Hello? Hey.  
Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. I think you mixed us two up.  
This is Speed. Okay. I have a question.  
I'm in the Metro Detroit area, and I recently inherited a family home. And so this is new to me  
after I ran across you on social media. When I'm trying to figure out maybe the return on the  
investment, it seems to be a no-brainer.  
But one question I had as it pertains to rent. I noticed, for example, on your advertisement, you  
said room starting at. Do you base the rent ever off of maybe a percentage of their actual  
income? I do it like that, and I do it based on level of care.  
Okay. Okay. And to get started, would you say the person should get go ahead and apply for  
LLC right away? Yeah.You definitely need an LLC. Okay. Okay.  
That's all the questions I have for now. Thank you. Last name, family? Yes.  
Yes. I'm in Cyprus, and they have the HOA stuff. Do I have to get a permit to open up and say,  
like, if I wanted to turn this house around? Cyprus need a permit.  
Go to Harris County Permitting Center. Go to what? I'm sorry. Harris County Permitting Center.  
All right. So I go there first and get a permit. If you got a house, you got to have a house first.  
This house I'm standing in, I'm going to turn this house into it. Okay. Well, then you'll go to  
Harris County.  
All right. And then once I do that, I have my LLC. I go get the permit, and then I start.  
I just want kids, though. I was thinking about, like, you know, teenagers. Well, that's not the  
answer.  
The answer is going through the state of Texas. You have to be licensed for youth. Oh, so you  
have to be licensed for youth.  
Yeah. How you going to have damn kids? You ain't got no license. Okay.  
So just for adults, is the only way you could be unlicensed? Okay. All right. How long you take to  
get licensed? About six to 12 months.  
And you have to go through all of the programs and stuff? Is it similar to getting foster kids?  
And you need a sprinkler system. Okay. And is it similar to getting foster kids, like the  
programs? No.  
Okay. Do you have to have $50,000 in a bank? Do you have to show money? Yes. Yes.  
Okay. All right. All right.  
Thank you. You're welcome. Last name Austin? Last name Austin? Can you hear me? Hello? I  
can hear you.  
Hi. So I'm starting fresh. I know nothing, have nothing.  
Do you recommend the A to Z course for you? Or how does the mentorship work? What do you  
recommend with starting fresh and getting running? So with the A to Z course, it's like self-  
starter. It does go over the blueprint from A to Z. It does include all of the documents you need  
to successfully start and run your business. And the mentorship is just ongoing support.  
Okay. Thank you. You're welcome.  
Ronald? Yes. Hi. Thank you.So I'm a veteran and I want to use my VA loan to purchase a three-family home in Boston with  
each floor, three bedrooms, each floor. Am I allowed to use the VA loan and turn it into a group  
home? I don't know if you have any stipulation on it needing to be your primary resident or not.  
So you have to check on that.  
Yeah. I know for the first year it has to be a primary residence, but after the first year, then you  
can move out somewhere else. Okay.  
Well, then that's your answer. Oh, okay. Okay.  
Thank you. You're welcome. Chris Mills? Hi.  
Can you hear me? I can hear you. Okay. Do the men and women have to be separated? No, they  
don't.  
Okay. Can they be in the same room? No. Okay.  
So male, male, female, female regardless. Yes. Okay.  
Cool. Thank you. You're welcome.  
Charlie Williams? Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Okay. First question.  
How do you deal with homeowner associations? And also, do you prefer to have your group  
home within the city or would rural areas work as well? You have to look at the bylaws on your  
homeowner's association to see if they allow short-term, long-term rentals. As far as where I  
will be, most people like the city. If you look in the house, people with sex-related crimes, the  
rural areas will likely work.  
Okay. Camille Wright? Hi. Yes.  
My question is, once you go to medicare.gov and you pull up the hospitals and the dialysis  
facilities and all those other places in your area, when you say cold call, are you saying call each  
one of them and are you just letting them know, like, hey, I have a home, you know, availability  
if you guys are looking for placement, for patients? Yeah. You will just reach out to them and,  
you know, go into your spiel. Okay.  
Okay. Thank you. Don't you see something? Ms. Johnson.  
Hey. Good afternoon. Good evening.  
Ms. Nett, I want to know how often do you do these webinars? Sporadically. Sporadically. Okay.  
And also share with you that I used to work for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice for 10  
years in the rural area and, like, Rochere and area. And it's a lot of offenders that cannot go  
home because they don't have nowhere to go. So thank you for sharing information.And I'm going to get back with you on getting started. Okay. You're welcome.  
All right. Alvin Lesper. Oh, hello, Ms. Nett.  
How are you doing? I'm fine. How are you? Good, good. I'm in the Charlotte area.  
And I got a quick question as far as how to get going. To reach out, do I reach out to the unit of  
case managers at the prisons or do I reach out to parole office? Like, today I reached out to the  
parole office. Hello? I said both.  
You'll reach out to both. Okay. Okay.  
Thank you. You're welcome. Any last questions? I have a question.  
Okay, Ms. Martin. Your website, does it actually show individuals when they are coming to your  
site after you do cold calls? It gives them information. Are we able to access that to see what  
they're seeing? Okay.  
We asked that question again. You have a professional website, I assume, set up that  
represents your business, correct? Yeah. It's being modified.  
Okay. So, is it accessible now or it will be accessible later just to view? Because you can go on  
photos inside of Groupons for Newbies where people have been posting their flyers and look at  
their website link and just type it in the chat. Okay.  
Okay. Thank you. Last name, family? Yeah.  
When it first started, you had gave the number to do the virtual, I think it was a virtual mailbox.  
I didn't get a chance to get that number. Oh, oh, what? Oh, oh.  
You was giving it like a phone number, three, four, six number at the beginning. Yeah. I don't  
have that phone on me right now to pull the number.  
I know it's three, four, six, six hundred. Did anybody else take it down that you could share with  
him, please? Nine, six, twenty-six. I think it is a twenty-five.  
We put in a check. Oh, I'm disabled. Hold on a minute.  
Three, four, six. I'll write it down right now. Okay.  
Somebody can put it in the chat. I'll have access. You guys get the number.  
I got it right here. Three, four, six, six, zero, zero, nine, six, two, six. Okay.  
Thank you. Ms. Nett, I don't know how to wave my hand. Okay.  
I just want to know, is there, outside of today, is there another time that we can do the layaway  
plan for the 997? Yeah. I'll probably be running another webinar next week sometime. Okay.But you can copy the link. I don't disable the link. Oh, that'll be on your page? In the chat.  
In the chat. Okay. Gotcha.  
Thank you. Hi, Ms. Nett. I cannot raise my hand, but I have a question.  
I live in a rural area, outskirts of town, and it's more or less like the country, and it's  
unincorporated. So I guess my question would be, do I need to check for zoning? Where you  
live? I live in Jackson County, Florida, which is like Mariana. Let's get started.  
Okay. All right. And one other question, and this question is for my sister.  
She has a, all about the home care business. And she hasn't, she got all her credentials, but she  
hasn't got started yet. So under, under this umbrella, could she actually work that business?  
She already has her LLC and everything.  
What you mean? What you mean? Okay. What I mean is under her LLC is all about the home  
care. So could she incorporate the unlicensed independent living? You asking? No, she needs  
two separate entities.  
Two separate entities. Okay. Okay.  
That was my question. Okay. Okay.  
All right. Thank you. Vicki Richard.  
Yes, ma'am. My question is, I'm wanting to go to the last conference that you're having. And I'm  
wondering about the 997 that you're offering tonight.  
What, you know, should I get that? Or will I learn all that there? You'll learn it at the conference.  
Okay. Thank you so much.  
You're welcome. Miss Lisa Phillips. Hello, Lynette.  
Thank you for all that you do. You're welcome. Yes, I kind of got my answer about the go ahead  
and get started.  
Because the town I live in, I have been going back and forth with them for about two weeks  
with the city manager. She said they don't have anything for any permits for that. And basically,  
to go ahead and get started.  
I wanted my question was, when dealing with the agencies for leads, are they going to want to  
see permit? No. Okay, I'm good. I'm ready.  
Thank you. Kimberly Williams. Hello, I'm sorry.  
I was trying to unmute. So I purchased the course and I missed the part about the the in-person conference you're having. Will the same is the same information in the course? Or  
should I also attend the conference? It's a little bit different.  
Of course, you won't get access to the guest panelists this weekend. What I've been doing for  
those that wanted to have access to the course and go to the conference. I can do the  
conference half off.  
The difference is, you know, of course, the conference, you don't get a replay. Whereas with the  
course, you get to watch it over and over and over. But for the most part, my presentation is  
mirrors the course.  
90%. But of course, like I said, the other panelists and things like that won't be in the course.  
Okay, and when is the conference? August 22nd and 23rd.  
Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I won't even be able to attend the conference.  
Okay, so as long as I have this course, I can still get going. And I'm in North Carolina. Do I have  
any stipulations or anything to hold me? Because if you say 45 days, I want to be up and  
running in 45 days.  
You can only have six in North Carolina. Six people per house? Uh-huh. Okay, all right.  
So I need multiple houses. Okay, thank you, ma'am. But some people do more.  
Just stay off the radar. Where I'll be, people too nosy. I'm gonna do the right thing because  
they'll tell it.  
Okay. Ms. Angela Butler. Okay, thank you.  
Appreciate it. My question is, is it hard to get folks in like a mobile home park? Yeah, if you have  
a mobile home and you paid a lot rent and all that, is it hard to get them in that type of  
community? Or just it's better to get a house on the outside? Uh, where you live? Georgia. Uh,  
yeah, you can do it.  
Okay, all right. I just need to talk with the property managers on site. Yes.  
Okay. All right, I'll do that. All right, thank you.  
Hi, could I ask a question? I can't raise my hand. Go ahead. Um, I know you said as far as the  
parolees not having an address to go to, so they feel locked up 65 or older, have their SSI  
already started? Have they started that process? Or is that something that you normally help  
with? Or were not able to? You asked if you help with starting the process? Yes.  
Yeah, you can help. Okay. All right, thank you.  
Okay. Um, um, yeah. Hi, Ms. Nutt.I just got a question. I'm in the state of Georgia and, um, I was wondering, do I need a license? I  
know you said the term you don't use, Groupon, so what term am I going to use? Independent  
living. Okay, so I don't need a license? No.  
Okay, thank you. I have a question. Okay.  
Hi, my name is Tabitha. I'm in Georgia as well. I currently have a home, um, a rental property  
that I'm actually setting up.  
But I also have a personal care home as well. Um, so I'm thinking about, I've been doing my  
flyers on seniors, veterans, and, um, and I also reached out to the prison, um, about getting my  
name on their, um, list of trying to do the reentry. What is the, and I, and I was reading your,  
um, post on the number of people in the house.  
What is the number of people requiring, um, that we can have in the house? I currently have a  
three bedroom, but one of the rooms, they actually transfer, um, they turn the garage into a  
room where I literally. It's 200 square feet per person. Okay.  
So it's almost something like my personal care home. You go by the square footage on the  
rooms. Okay.  
Okay. And that's what I want to make sure. And then I am, um, saying independent living as  
well.  
A co, um, co-living, um, so that I'm not saying, um, group home. Yes, ma'am. Okay.  
That's what I wanted to make sure. And then I also want to know if, um, the program that  
you're offering tonight, um, now that would details and that would pretty much detail  
everything that you would need. Cause I'm already have, have a house.  
I'm trying to make sure if it would be beneficial to go ahead and sign up for the program or, or  
is it, do you have something? If I just want to you to be my mentor as far as like helping me, you  
know, guide me through it. Um, do you have, do I have that option? Yeah. I'll post both the  
links.  
Okay. All right. Thank you so much.  
It's 200 square feet per person. Um, Ms. Martin, Ms. Wright. Hello.  
Um, I purchased your course just now and I can't access it. Is it a certain time that I need to wait  
before I can actually access it? Um, it's going to notify me once we get out of here. Okay.  
I'll send you a different link. Okay. Thank you so much.  
Automatically. Okay. Okay.  
Ms. Tara. Hi. Um, I'm in California.Will the course benefit me? Yes, ma'am. It's for all 50 states. All 50 states.  
Okay. And if I wanted to upgrade later on, am I able to do that? For mentorship? Yes. Yes.  
You would just pay, uh, the difference. Okay. Great.  
Thank you. You're welcome. Mr. Kelly.  
Okay. Um, hello, uh, Lynette. Uh, first of all, I wanted to touch on the question that was asked, I  
believe from Ms. Wilson.  
You may have misheard her. Um, she was asking about parolees who were 65 or older, not  
having an address to parole to, she was asking about, is there SSI already started? Um, or is  
that, okay. So that is something that we would have to help them with.  
Yeah. You don't get any money while incarcerated. Okay.  
So it's not building up on back there. Nothing like that. That's crazy.  
And, uh, second part, uh, how are you looking in 2026 for your, for your tours and everything? I  
can't do anything this year. I think I would express that to you. Yeah.  
We, we, um, have not set a date yet. Okay. But you will be, but you will be out there though,  
right? Yes.  
Okay, cool. All right. Thank you.  
You're welcome. All right. Okay.  
Okay. I have one quick question. You'll be in Atlanta and, and, uh, Georgia in September.  
Is that correct? Or did I see that wrong? Yeah. If so for somebody else's event. Oh, so it has  
nothing to do with you.  
You just speak like, um, no, I'll be speaking. Okay. So I'll be purchasing the course.  
Okay. Okay. Thank you so much.  
You're welcome. Alrighty, you all. Um, if you have any additional questions, feel free to post it  
inside of group homes for newbies.  
I'll be monitoring the group, uh, tonight and I'll try to get an answer. If not tonight, first thing in  
the morning. I appreciate you all for tuning in.  
Um, and just a reminder. Um, the Charlotte North Carolina conference is August 22nd and 23rd.  
Uh, and we will be in, um, Miami, Florida on September 19th and 20th doing a networking  
event.If you all are in Florida, I highly, um, encourage you all to be in the mix and other States are  
welcome as well. Um, tomorrow I will be doing a webinar at five o'clock PM on the loophole to  
being able to take possession of abandoned houses. If you all want that link, um, you can inbox  
me on Facebook and I will get that to you.  
And so, yeah, I'll see y'all in the group and I'll talk to you all later.
