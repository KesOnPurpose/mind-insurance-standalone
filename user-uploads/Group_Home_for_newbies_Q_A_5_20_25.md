Group Home for newbies Q\&A 5:20:25  
It's dark in here. Hey, guys, Johnny Trump. I'm in Detroit, Michigan.  
I started my group home journey in 2019\. It's going on six years, isn't it? Before I started in  
group homes, I was a over-the-road truck driver. One of my stops set up like a truck stop.  
I'm looking on the internet, and I saw a course on how to start a group home, which had always  
been in the back of my mind. I come from the, I used to be a nurse for a long time. So I always  
thought about that, a way to house some of the people that were being discharged.  
One thing leads to another, I'm on a layover on one of my over-the-road trips. And I called a  
realtor, a lady, and let her know what I was looking for. And she said, I have something for you  
right now.  
She showed me two buildings. One of those buildings was a fourplex, and it needed work. I  
didn't have the money for that.  
And then she showed me the second house, where this lady was trying to run it as a group  
home, but she had no idea what to do. Neither did I. But she wasn't comfortable in the  
neighborhood. She said, you can have this house today if you want.  
I was like, bet. I had the money that she wanted. It was an eight-bedroom home.  
That next day, I signed all the paperwork, gave her the money, and I was in a group home  
business. And I didn't know crap. I think Annette knows this.  
I probably paid, what, $200 for that course? So it was very sparse. But they got me started.  
There were three people in the house already.  
One was, two of those were not paying rent, and one was selling drugs out of the house. Took  
me about a week to get all three of them out, and I was in business. So I started off with non-  
licensed and transformed into a license.  
And here we are today in 2025, still on this journey, and I'm loving it. Thank you, Johnny. Yeah,  
me and Johnny go way back from, like, 2020\.  
So we've been knowing each other for five years. He's, him and Bahala, I don't know if she's on  
tonight, but we go way, way back. I saw Bahala, she's here.  
Okay, yeah. All right, so let's get started. So for those of you who are asking about the two-day  
conference, here is the rest of the stops for the year so that you can screenshot it so that you'll  
have those dates.  
All right, so tonight's topic will be discussing demographics, unlicensed versus licensed. How  
much should you charge? How do you get your first resident? Market analysis, SWOT, and ruralarea marketing. So understanding demographics.  
So you'll have to identify who you want to serve, whether it's seniors, veterans, disabled adults,  
the working class, re-entry or returning citizens, et cetera. So each and every one of you  
thought about starting a group home and you should have already had an idea of who you  
would like to serve, but you will learn that there is such a huge need for safe, clean, and  
affordable housing across the country because we are in the midst of a nationwide housing  
crisis. It's gonna be so many people who will need your services.  
So you may not just stick to that one demographic that pulled on your heartstring to want you  
to open up a home, whether licensed or unlicensed. And I do recommend, like I told you all  
earlier, when I first started this business, I wanted to target people who are returning from  
prison because I worked in a prison setting for almost five years, three different prison units,  
and I just saw the need. And after getting started, I now serve nine other demographics outside  
of returning citizens.  
So definitely make sure that you cast a wide net and take in those who you can accommodate  
safely. I like to also tell people who are new that most people fit under multiple demographics.  
So just give you one case to support, let's just say a returning citizen, somebody who's coming  
back from prison, returning from prison, that person may be a veteran, that person may also  
be a senior, that person may also live with mental health challenges, that person may also be a  
sex offender.  
So that person falls under multiple demographics. So if you get people in your home like that,  
then you don't wanna just limit yourself to reentry when now you've opened up the door of  
dealing with people who are seniors, people who live with mental illnesses, people who have  
physical challenges. So just keep that in mind that people fall under multiple demographics and  
so you don't wanna limit yourself.  
And another thing that I want you to know that one of the misconceptions that I hear a lot is  
people wanna house seniors because they get the idea in their mind that if I house seniors, I'm  
gonna get a lot of money. But you have to understand that poor people get old too. So just  
because they're a senior don't mean that they're gonna come with a lot of money.  
Just because they have a lot of physical limitations or diagnoses don't mean they're gonna have  
a lot of money. That's another misconception. People feel like, oh, a person who is bedridden  
on a feeding tube and got a trach in their throat that, oh, they should at least be able to pay  
$5,000 a month.  
No, there are people who are poor that break down and decline just like people who are  
wealthy. So kinda keep that in mind when you are starting your journey that don't put costs  
with someone's age or medical complications because you'll find out that that's not the case.  
When you are able to charge people more money for services is because they have the income  
to support their living arrangements or your fee is not because of their medical ailments.So know your ideal client's income level needs and payer source. So if your ideal client is  
someone who's gonna pay you $5,000 a month, $10,000 a month, then you're gonna need to  
know how to position yourself to be able to target those individuals. So consider location and  
access to services in the area.  
And by that is, if you wanna target somebody that's $5,000 a month, that's able to pay you  
$5,000 a month for a shared room or $7,000 a month for a private room, you can't be in the  
hood. You're not gonna find those people. So you have to make sure that you consider the  
location of your home to be able to target those individuals.  
And when you are marketing, people who are wealthy go to hospitals that are typically private  
pay or private insurance companies versus Medicaid. If you are in a area that's flooded with  
providers that accept Medicaid or people who are credentialed for Medicaid, then that gives,  
that's a big indicator that you're somewhere in a property stricken area and you might wanna  
reconsider some things if they can't pay what you're looking for. And when you're getting  
started in this business, you definitely want to do your numbers first so that when you are out  
marketing, you can know what population you're gonna be able to serve in order to make the  
money that you're looking to make.  
So unlicensed versus licensed. Unlicensed is faster to launch. Fewer regulations often serve  
private pay or community-based clients.  
Licensed requires state compliance, credentialing inspections, and staffing requirements.  
Choose based on who you want to serve and how fast you wanna get started. So here's my take  
on unlicensed and licensed.  
So with the unlicensed model, of course, that's what I do is pretty much a non-medical home.  
We're not providing any type of medical services directly. We're not assisting with any type of  
activities of daily living directly.  
We use third-party organizations to bridge the gap for individuals needing those services. It  
can't... Another misconception is people feel like just because someone is licensed, they make  
more money than someone who's unlicensed. That is a misconception.  
How you make money determines your target audience. With the licensed population, with  
licensed homes, there are some instances where you can make more money when you're  
dealing with people who live with severe mental health challenges or severe intellectual  
disabilities. And they're on a waiver program and they are rated based on how severe their  
diagnoses are or their behaviors are.  
And then you might get a little bit more money that way. But if you're not targeting people who  
have IDD or severe mental illness, what we call SMI, then all other populations, there's no way  
that you're gonna just bill based on the behavior levels. But I look at the licensed homes having  
that shiny medal to be able to say that you're licensed.So no difference then. Let's just say, for instance, comparing it to a mechanic. You got the  
shade tree mechanics that you know they can do the job.  
May cost a little bit less. They may give you the hookup. Then you have people who are  
licensed, right? Licensed mechanics who got a shop.  
They do charge certain premiums, but it don't necessarily mean that they're better than  
someone who's unlicensed. That just mean they went through the requirements to be able to  
be licensed and be held accountable to licensed standards. And then you also have those  
people who, let's just say shade tree mechanics, charge just as much as the people who are  
licensed because they know their worth, they know their value.  
And although they're not licensed, they're able to target a certain demographic of people for  
their services. And another thing you can do is make sure that you have your home set up nice  
to be able to target people who have money to be able to afford your rate. And by nice, I mean,  
of course, don't take a lot of shortcuts when you're furnishing your home.  
Don't take shortcuts on where you position your home. If you actually invest in a nice home,  
people are going to come in and be able to pay your premium for the lifestyle that they're  
going to live. And what else I wanted to note on that? Oh, if you're in an area or if you're in a  
state that don't require, let's just say a fire suppression system to become licensed.  
I don't try to deter people from getting licensed. I teach the unlicensed model because there  
are some states that have a higher barriers to entry for the license model. So let's just say for  
instance, for the state of Texas, if you want to house more than four people in a home and they  
need care, they require us to have a license.  
And with the license, they require a fire suppression system. And based on the square footage  
of the home, that can run you anywhere between 30 to $50,000 for the investment. And then of  
course, you have to actually purchase the property in order to get a license because you don't  
want to put a 30 to $50,000 investment in a rental property.  
It makes no sense to drive the value up for someone else's home. So you have states like  
Michigan and Ohio, Georgia, maybe Florida, I'm not 1000% sure that don't require you to have  
that fire suppression system based on a number of people in your home. It could be six to eight  
people that you can house without having to make that investment, but you're still licensed.  
So of course, if you are in that situation, I do encourage you to get licensed if you want to. But if  
you are in the area where it's a high investment to be able to obtain the license, then stick to  
the unlicensed model and utilize third party organizations to bridge those gaps for any type of  
nursing services or ADLs that need to be completed for the individuals in your home. That's why  
in the unlicensed homes, we service independent or semi-independent individuals.  
And with our semi-independent individuals, we use those third party organizations to bridge  
those gaps. And that's the reason why we are able to remain unlicensed because the third partyorganizations carry a license. And so how much should you charge? So for group homes, you  
can charge, let's just say a daily rate anywhere between 25 to $150 per day, depending on the  
location and the services that you're offering.  
And again, this is licensed and unlicensed rates. For a home care agency, so we will be talking  
more about home care agencies, hospice agencies, and home health care agencies inside of  
Group Homes for Newbies community, because I really want you all to focus on starting your  
group home, getting it filled, but also bringing in multiple streams of income and wraparound  
services so that you can get paid multiple times off of your residence. And then of course, you  
have to consider your expenses, the staffing, rent, food, transportation, and licensing if it  
applies to you.  
So how do you get your first resident? You wanna make sure that you build relationships with  
discharge planners, social workers, case managers, employees, employers, et cetera. You'll  
hear people talk about discharge planners and social workers and case managers when they're  
dealing with certain populations, right? So if you're dealing with people who have mental health  
struggles, physical disabilities, seniors who just have generalized weaknesses, I don't know if I  
said mental health struggles, but mental health struggles, people who have intellectual  
disabilities, things like that, those people will likely be referred to you by a social worker  
discharge planner or case manager. But let's just say, for instance, you wanna target people  
who are returning citizens.  
You will be looking for people inside the prisons that focus on reentry. They're working in the  
reentry department. So whether it's federal prison, county jails, state jails, or just yours, so you  
got county jails, state jails, state prisons, federal prisons, those four, you'll be looking in the  
reentry department.  
If you're looking for like travel nurses, flight attendants, cadets for different classes, people  
working in warehouses or working in plants or traveling in for contract work, things like that,  
though you will be targeting different employers, plant supervisors, or project managers. And  
you'll be marketing on different platforms like Facebook, paying for SEOs on your Google  
profile, things like that. So it's common to hear people say, oh, go to social workers.  
But before I tell somebody how to get a client, how to get their first resident, I need to know  
who are you looking to target because it's not a one size fit all. This business model, like I said, I  
serve about 10 different demographics alone, but at the two-day conference, I talk about over  
25 different demographics and going through those 25 different demographics, there's  
different people that you have to connect with in order to get leads from them. So don't just  
think that everybody that you serve, you're gonna get it from a social worker because that's  
simply not the case.  
Show proof of readiness. Get your intake forms ready. Clean your house, stage your home, get  
clear pricing and offer solutions to discharge problems and not just the bed.So me and one of my mentees, Fallon, we went and did a Lunch and Learn Monday. And so we  
was there talking to various social workers, RN case managers, and the director of social  
services. And so although we were in there pitching her group home in my home care agency,  
when we were communicating with the director, we started asking questions to the director to  
see what their pain points was.  
And I don't know if you all caught my live yesterday or Monday when I was giving a recap of the  
meeting that me and Fallon had with the Lunch and Learn. So basically, when you are dealing  
with referral partners, you wanna see what their pain points are. Everybody have pain points,  
especially inside of hospital settings.  
One of the pain points, because she gave so many, but one of the pain points she had was  
people who can't get discharged because of renal failure. And in order for them to discharge  
them, they have to secure a chair at a dialysis company. Without securing a chair at the dialysis  
company, they can't discharge them.  
And one of the barriers that they have is dialysis companies not wanting to give them a chair  
because they have no insurance and they don't have any income. So that leaves the hospital in  
a bind because they have people waiting to be discharged. And they can't get them discharged  
due to no income and no insurance for them to be able to get their dialysis.  
And most times people on dialysis have to go two to three times a week for that care. And that's  
one of many barriers that hospitals face by not having proper things in order for people once  
they have to return them to the community. Because by law, they can't just discharge them  
back home or to the streets without having proper care lined up.  
Even if it's to the extent of someone needing home health care, they still need physical therapy.  
They have IV where they have to get antibiotics. Yeah, they've met discharge at the hospital, but  
they can't release them to the street or they can't release them home without having their  
home health care services set up for them to come into home and treat them.  
So it's a lot of things that hospitals deal with on a regular and consistent basis that they lack  
resources. And so my goal is to always figure out what their pain points are and how I can help  
alleviate some of those things. Because when you become a true problem solver and when you  
become a true solutionist in your community, people are gonna call on you for everything.  
You're gonna be their go-to person. So regardless of all the people that came before you, or  
let's just say regardless of all the people that came before me and fell in to this particular  
hospital, I don't worry about who came in before me because I know that the people that came  
in before me was only coming in to figure out how they can benefit for themselves versus  
establishing a true relationship or a true report with the staff in the hospital to actually help  
provide value to them in exchange for them giving us clients or residents. So I know that I went  
live.So somebody should be able to have an answer for how I was able to solve the problem for the  
social worker at the hospital that me and Fallon did the Lunch and Learn. So who wanna  
unmute and tell everyone what problem, how did I solve her problem? You connected one of  
the social workers with somebody that you knew from out of town. I believe that's what you  
were stating.  
I used to. No, not from out of town. They weren't from the same city.  
I know that much. They were from different cities. Yeah, you pretty much got it.  
So what, so basically, oh, go ahead. Anybody else wanna try? Yes, somebody in your network.  
That's you, Ms. Connie.  
Yes, ma'am. Yes, I was the one who said someone, you connected them with someone in your  
network. Okay, so.  
This is Sanchez Sanchez that was making a comment. I'm a newbie. Hey, Ms. Sanchez, what you  
got? Well, I work in home health.  
So I know that the ability that you were able to do is you were able to be able to come in and  
provide resources that the other people weren't doing by just coming in and retrieving the  
referrals when the people are ready to discharge to ensure that their home health services and  
discharge planning was pretty much together where they're getting numbers where you're  
coming in and providing the solution for those patients that don't meet the standard and the  
basic requirements to be able to have a proper and safe discharge. And so that gave them the  
ability and gives them the ability to be able to know that when they have a discharge that is a  
difficult discharge and they don't have anywhere for the people to discharge because once the  
hospitals have provided them medical clearance to be able to discharge the social workers and  
the caseworkers job now is to make sure that they can get those people out of the hospital. And  
if you can provide services to find placement for them they're gonna seek you first because  
they know that you can help them accomplish their goal by getting that safe discharge and  
preventing the hospital to have to incur additional costs because they know that the insurance  
companies are not going to pay once that person has been cleared to be medically discharged.  
I appreciate your feedback Ms. Sanchez but so for those that answer, those were good answers  
but that's not how, that's not the resolution that I came up with for the hospital. So y'all didn't  
listen to my Zoom. I mean, my Facebook live got me wasting my time.  
I'm a newbie so give me a break. I got you, I'm giving you grace. Okay, go ahead.  
I said I'm taking notes. I'm ready, give it to me. Okay, but you, I mean, but you were telling her  
that you were telling, you told her that people that have end stage renal disease are quick to  
get financial help.  
They can get a check. So there's some solutions to that. You can get, do something temporarilyuntil you can get them rolling with a check and some insurance.  
Yeah, you said it take you like 45, you could take 30 to 45 days to get those checks. Okay, I see  
what you're saying, okay. All right, so I'm gonna answer the question.  
So hold on, let me meet y'all, let me meet y'all back. All right, so what I told the social worker  
and what I did for her was, so with people who, ooh, do I wanna say, I said I wasn't gonna say it  
on the Zoom call cause I'd be wanting other people to pay attention but I'm gonna say it. So  
this is through lived experience.  
This isn't something that someone told me. This is something that I experienced throughout  
my four years of doing this business. You learn things.  
And so on my end of the thing of, let's just say the social workers have their role and housing  
providers have their role. So within my role, I've learned that people who have renal failure or  
kidney failure, they automatically qualify for SSI or their social security disabilities if they paid  
into it. Well, how they help the hospital.  
So I also dealt with people who have not had a dialysis chair. And so when I bring in people who  
don't have a chair, I take them to the hospital for compassionate dialysis. So what I told the  
social worker is, if she allows us to be able to bring in the patient or bring in the client through  
the ER for compassionate dialysis, if she gives me 30 to 45 days with doing the compassionate  
dialysis, I can casework the individual and be able to get them their social security benefits,  
which in turn will give them their insurance, which in turn will allow them to get a chair at a  
dialysis clinic.  
And now I have put together some pieces for that social worker, because she did not know how  
soon someone will be able to get insurance. She didn't know how soon they'll start being able  
to get income. And she definitely didn't have resources or she didn't think about discharging  
people with the understanding that they'll be able to get compassionate dialysis and make that  
agreement with the group homes for those people to not lack any care.  
Not all hospitals. No, she actually been a social worker, the director at the hospital for 13 years.  
So, some people just don't think outside the box.  
People are so accustomed to routine to where sometimes that's why we mastermind and that's  
why we bounce ideas off of one another to be able to problem solve. And so that's exactly what  
me and that social worker, the director did. And she actually takes my phone.  
I also was able to provide her with one of my, I call it a book, a ebook, but it's not an ebook. It's  
a PDF file on anybody who, if she, basically if I gave her a resource to where based on any  
diagnoses that she see that the patients have at the hospital, if she go to my PDF file, those  
people that's listed or those diagnosis that's listed on my PDF file can get immediate funding,  
whether social security or SSI or whatever the case. I mean, yeah, whatever benefit they are  
allowed based on certain diagnoses, there's even a criteria where people can get same dayemergency funding.  
If anybody was on Dunn's sales call, I provided you with that particular PDF and that breakdown  
of people who are able to get emergency funding. Basically they front them the money  
contingent on being approved anyway due to those diagnoses and they can get paid within the  
same week. So like I said, through lived experience, through building my network, through  
different masterminds, I'm able to approach different social workers with resolutions to any  
problem that they have.  
Will your PDF file work in every state? Absolutely, because social security is a federal. It's the  
same, this file is basically, I pulled it from social security. All right, so let me move on.  
I gotta minimize the chat box because I can't have it on the screen. So if you asking me  
questions and I'm not answering this because I don't have the chat box up anymore. All right,  
so market analysis.  
So you want to look at demographics, competitors, pricing, referral sources, and location  
demand. So when you are doing your market analysis, you have to determine who are you  
serving. You have to also see how many homes or agencies exist nearby.  
What are others charging daily, hourly, monthly, weekly, whatever the case may be. How many  
or what kind of hospitals are nearby, prisons, case managers, and things like that. And so I  
know last week I talked about, how did I word it? Cause I just be running my mouth on live  
sometimes.  
Basically, I do some data scraping for the most part, for lack of better terms. I try to figure out  
how many social workers are in my area. So basically I like to run numbers.  
That's how I word it. I build my business based on the numbers and not what other people are  
saying. So I'm a real, I'm big on statistics.  
And so I know that if there's a thousand social workers in my area, then I'm also look at how  
many of those social workers of those thousand work in a setting where my leads come from.  
So of that thousand, if there are 600 social workers that work in, whether it is a mental health  
hospital, a rehabilitation center, a nursing home, a traditional hospital, I'm going to, if it's 600  
people, let's just say for instance, if it's 600 people in Houston that work in the area where I  
need them to work in, in order to get my leads, then it's my job to be able to make connections  
with 600 social workers in my area, whether it's social workers, case managers, or discharge  
planners. When people talk about, oh, you know, I'm struggling to fill my beds, it's all based on  
numbers.  
It's all based on numbers. So you have to do your market analysis in order to see what the  
outcome will look like. It's your job to go out and find the people that's going to be able to fill  
up your home.And it's your job to figure out how you're going to make that connection and provide value to  
them. You have to be able to stand out because when you got, if you're in a city and it has, let's  
just say when you do your, you run your competitor numbers. Now with the unlicensed model,  
you might not be able to get true numbers because there's like no directory for the most part,  
depending on where you live, where you'll be able to actually see how many homes are in your  
area.  
So that might not work for the unlicensed model as much as it will for a licensed facility because  
anything that's licensed, you'll be able to pull a directory up. You'll be able to sort it by city or  
your county or surrounding zip codes or, you know, narrowing it down and see what their  
numbers look like. Then I also look at what the average, let's just say in a group home setting, I  
look at numbers as far as, okay, well, the average house holds around seven to eight people in  
an unlicensed home.  
So I even break it down like that. I also run numbers on if my target audience is more so people  
who, and I'll tell you, I deal with reentry, people with physical disabilities, mental health, male to  
moderate, IDD, male to moderate, people who are sex offenders, who else? I can't freestyle  
them right now. AIDS and HIV, the LGBT community, aged out youth.  
So most times you'll hear people that say that they house people who are aged out and they  
are either licensed or have a contract with the state to get these people. The ones that I deal  
with are people who no longer wanna be associated with, hold on one second. Oh, you think  
I'm talking to myself? No, yeah, I'm in a meeting.  
I don't want nothing. Cause like you clearly see me talking. Can you hear me? So there's people  
who are aged out in foster care that no longer wants to deal with people.  
They don't wanna be associated with the state anymore. They deal with, live with a lot of  
trauma, was mistreated through their foster parents, the regulations or the rules that they had  
to abide by. So they turn 18 or turn 21 and then they, you know, wanna wash their hands with  
it.  
But some of those individuals still need safe, clean and affordable housing options. So those  
are the people that I target when I say aged out foster youth are those who either don't wanna  
be on that program where the aged out or simply don't qualify for it. So out of all those  
demographics, I narrow it down of how many of those people are in my area.  
How many of those people, let's just say sex offenders, how many sex offenders are in my area  
that need these houses? Because of course they have barriers that they have to cross, which is-  
Can you hear me? Yeah, Ashley. Oh, what was that? They have barriers that they have to cross,  
which of course getting jobs, people who have a criminal background, it may take, it's  
challenging for them to get employment. When they're a sex offender, it's challenging for them  
to be able to live in apartments.Can you hear me, Shay? Ashley. So just basically running your numbers, seeing how many  
people fit in that category, or even with people, let's just say SSI, look at how, you know,  
Google, how many people in the state of Texas or in the city of Houston are on SSI? And you get  
a number. How many people are drawn with social security benefits? You get a number.  
How many people in my area are over the age of 65? You get a number. So you have to pull that  
data in order to help motivate you to be able to connect with all of the individuals that need  
your services. If you're not looking at different numbers in your different category, and you're  
just blindly starting a business, blindly marketing, then you're gonna probably feel discouraged  
because you're doing it in the blind.  
So you have to be able to run the numbers. You have to know what your competitors are doing.  
You have to know what their price points is.  
So even if you're doing some cold calling or calling around to different other group homes or  
other assisted living facilities, just to kind of see what the price points are, you wanna stay in  
the race. So you're not too, too high and not able to provide the services or value needed to be  
able to match that price, or you don't wanna be too, too low to where you're doing yourself a  
disservice. So doing a market analysis is what you should be doing for any business that you  
are starting.  
So give me for an example. You're considering opening a group home in a rural area called  
Liberty County, Texas. You realize that there's only two other unlicensed homes in the area.  
The nearest hospital is 40 minutes away from the home that you're trying to start, and they  
have frequent discharge delays. The area has a large aging population who has fixed income.  
Social workers say they have nowhere to send veterans or seniors after rehab.  
Local homes charge anywhere between 25 to $35 per day, and you plan to have that safe  
medium of $30 and offer that transportation. So after you are looking at what your competitors  
are offering, you definitely wanna see what you can do better. That's just what it's all about.  
I know we big on no competition. We just collabing, but at the end of the day, anybody that's  
doing what you're doing is essentially a competitor, and you have to know what your  
competitors are doing in order to have a thriving business. Of course, we're gonna collaborate,  
be able to help each other rise to the top when you do your collaboration.  
But essentially, if you look up the definition of what a competitor is, it's somebody that's doing  
the exact same thing that you're doing, and you definitely need to know what's happening at  
any type of facility around you that's doing what you're doing, not because you're trying to  
compete with them, but so that you know that you're keeping up with what's going on in the  
area. And of course, you need to offer more services or provide more value when possible  
because everybody, regardless if we're doing the same thing, we all have to have our own  
unique why. We have to have our own unique mission statement.Why you? You gotta have it. You gotta have it. So even with me talking to all of you, you're still  
my competitors, but we're collaborating right now.  
But you still my competitor. Don't get a twist. And I'm not telling y'all nothing that I don't do.  
Even with Will, website, I'm checking it. I'm having conversations. I know what you got going  
on.  
That's just what it is. And let's just say, for instance, you got Burger King. Let's just say the  
chicken sandwich went viral with Popeyes.  
How many other restaurants started selling chicken sandwiches? That was a new wave. They  
know what's going on. I want me some too.  
It is what it is. You have to know. You have to know what's going on.  
You gotta be in the know. All right. So how to use your market analysis.  
Choose the right area to open up your home care agency or your group home. Tailor your  
services based on unmet needs in the area. Stay competitive with your pricing that fits your  
audience, but of course you want to profit, but you want to have that healthy medium.  
Know what makes you stand out so you can clearly explain your value to social workers and  
families, and be able to be confident when answering questions when you are either  
networking or pitching. Now, as far as staying competitive with pricing, let's just say, for  
instance, the average house around here, unlicensed home on the average side, on the low  
income side, is about $850 a month, right? So those who are shopping around for homes, they  
know that the ballpark area for an unlicensed home, a healthy medium, would be about  
anywhere between 750 and 850, right? So if you have a group home that is shooting blind,  
don't know what's going on, don't know what the other people are doing in their area, and let's  
just say they say, oh, we charge $500 for a shared room, we charge $400 for a shared room.  
Nine times out of 10, if someone go, if you tell somebody that they're gonna associate your  
home being a crack house because of perceived value on the financial side, that's not what's  
going on in the area.  
So that's why you have to know how much people are charging in your area, in your city, or in  
your, not the entire city, but let's just say if you stay on the north side, what the north side  
going for, what the suburbs, the suburban area, or the upper class segment of society, what  
those homes going for, or in the hood, you know, you got to know what the numbers are. So  
you have to do that market analysis. And so next thing you wanna make sure you do is a SWOT  
analysis.  
A SWOT analysis, a SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Let me  
drink me some water real quick. All right, so this helps you evaluate your business both  
internally and externally.This tool gives you clarity on what you're doing well and what you need to do to grow, or, you  
know, your strengths and your weaknesses. Why does it matter? It helps you stay ahead of  
challenges, keeps your team focused on what makes you stand out, and help you make smarter  
business decisions. Okay, I'm gonna open a chat for a second cause I'm gonna ask a question.  
Y'all over here cutting up. Let me see. They're not always cutting up.  
Put a one in the chat if this is your first time hearing about a SWOT analysis or a market  
analysis. Well, you're a liar. All right, so this is, I'm gonna exit the chat again.  
This is something that you need to make sure that you educate yourself on. I'm giving like a  
brief overview. I'm not really going into like no heavy deep dive on it, but you need to have your  
market analysis when you starting a business, and then your SWOT analysis, you need to visit  
that quite often.  
I would say quarterly. Quarterly or twice a year you need to run a SWOT analysis. All right, so-  
Quarterly, quarterly.  
Okay. Yep. So your strengths, and this is an example.  
You own your home, low overhead, and have experience in direct care. Your weaknesses, no  
full-time staff yet, no brand recognition, limited marketing budget. And might I add, this is, it  
sounds like, it may sound like, how does this apply to group homes? Cause I'm running, this is, I  
kind of merge home care and group homes together because like I said, we about to turn up  
on some of these wraparound services.  
So that's why it sound like that. Cause of course we don't necessarily have staff in unlicensed  
homes, but you do have staff for the most part, no, for all parts, for licensed homes. And we  
have staff in home care agencies.  
Now, some unlicensed home do have staff as well, but we don't really talk about it as much  
because that's not a, that's not one of the things that we try to invest in when we first start out.  
We get us a house manager or house leader that we're not having to pay, but they essentially  
will be a staff. But anyways, cause if you don't have, if you're a house manager, that's a  
weakness.  
I be seeing y'all, y'all need a house man, need a house manager cause that's one of your  
weaknesses, okay? So no full-time staff yet or no house manager, no brand recognition in a  
limited marketing budget. Opportunities, high senior population, strong demand from  
hospitals and rehabilitation centers. Threats, competing homes nearby with established referral  
relationships.  
So let's just say for instance, I'm a, let's just say for instance, I'm gonna use Will so that, cause I  
know that he's not going to get offended. How you think? You'll get over it. So I will technically  
be a threat.Like when Will first started, and even probably now, depending on, I don't know, I don't know  
too much of his business, but let's just say for instance, I will be a threat to Will because I will be  
a technically a home nearby that's competing with him. And I've already established  
relationships with referral partners. I've already, I've been doing it for four years.  
So it's not a flex. Like when y'all see, if y'all see me posting on my Facebook stories and I'm  
posting leads every single day, I ain't doing it to flex. I'm doing it to motivate, to let you know  
that these people are in the area.  
People need our services because my homes are full, but I'm constantly marketing so that  
when I get leads, I can refer them out to other people in the community simply because when I  
am marketing, I do let social workers know or referral partners know that I have a strong  
network of other housing partners in the area that can accommodate if I don't. But, so I'm not  
doing it because it's like, oh, you know, I got it and you don't. I just have established those  
relationships over time.  
Whereas a new person that's just starting in the business or maybe been doing it for one year's  
time, you know, may look at, well, dang, you know, Nick got the blocks sold up. She know  
everybody. No, here's the cheat code.  
Just like I told y'all earlier, this is where my mind frame goes. If I know there is 600 social  
workers in my area, I am going to dig, dig, dig, dig to build up my Rolodex. I'm gonna build up  
my contact list.  
I'm gonna get close to 600 as possible because through my research and through the statistics,  
that's how many people in my area that should be referring me partners. I mean, referring me  
residents. If I look at the state of Texas got 32 prisons and this ain't factual information, I'm just  
saying something.  
If it's 32 prisons in the state of Texas and on average on a daily basis, on average they're  
releasing either by way of parole or discharging a sentence. If they are releasing on average of,  
let's just say 150 people a day. And of those 150 people, there are 70 people each day that don't  
got nowhere to go.  
And of those 70, it's 30 people each day that's over the age of 65 that ain't got nowhere to go. I  
need that. Those are mine.  
I need to figure out how to get it. So that's how you have to shape your mind when you are the  
new person on the block. You're the new kid on the block.  
Once you got the numbers and once you did your research and you know how many people  
that need your services, at that point you have to become an aggressive marketer, being  
consistent and following up. If you think that you're gonna run up these 600 contacts and they  
just gonna sit on your database and you're gonna talk to them, when you get ready, there's no  
true system in place, there's no true follow-up policy, then it's not gonna work for you. And I'mtelling you what I know.  
So just run back through it. You gonna have your strengths. Your strengths is, let's just say for  
McHale.  
McHale got strengths because he own all his properties. McHale owning his property versus me  
renting my properties, that's a strength for him, but that's a weakness for me because my  
overhead is a little bit more higher, just depends when he bought it and what his interest rate is  
compared to my houses are in the hood and they kind of a little low, but my profit margin  
would be much higher if I actually own those properties versus renting them. And so he have  
strengths because he actually own his house and he's not paying an additional three to $400  
over the market rent.  
So you have to understand when they list the house for 2,200 and they gonna give it to you for  
25, nine times out of 10, the mortgage ain't but 1,700. So you look at all that money that you  
giving away, which is lowering your profit margin. Let's just say for instance, with people who  
wanna open up an unlicensed personal care home and they're keeping whatever their state  
minimum is for them to be able to actually provide the care directly.  
I'm not getting into that tonight, but if they are already in and they've already been there and  
done that, they got the training, they got the skills, they got the degree. That's a strength for  
them versus me when I was just having a... At one point in time, when I first started my group  
home business in 2021, I didn't know nothing about no license. I didn't know nothing about  
who I was supposed to take or who I wasn't supposed to take.  
Cause again, like I said, when I started, I just started from an idea. I just started from seeing a  
need in the prison system that I wanted to provide a solution for. So I didn't know what I could  
or could not do because there weren't consultants out there.  
They weren't all these eBooks, these mentors, these coaches. You know, I ain't have all what  
y'all had. So when I got my first home, I moved those six people into my group home.  
Then I started getting people. Let's just say one guy had, oh my God, two people. Oh Lord,  
maybe three.  
So three people I had got over time from being inexperienced, listening to social workers that  
say, oh, you know, they can walk, they can still do their toileting and this, that, and the third  
because since I was so naive and didn't know at the time, I was taking in people, listening to the  
social workers and bringing them into the home and they practically bedridden because they  
ain't telling me they have good days and bad days. And on the bad days, they gonna have a BM  
in the bed. And here I am, never been a CNA, never been a caregiver, not a nurse, nothing.  
I just was a correctional officer and I worked in logistics. That's my background. And here I am  
with somebody in the bed that I need to change their diaper.That was a weakness for me. Whereas for somebody who's been in the healthcare field, they  
would have just turned them on over, cleaned them on up and called it a day. But for me, I had  
to get on YouTube, figure out how the proper way to change an adult diaper and cause it ain't  
like a baby.  
And then I had to figure out how I was gonna look at somebody's private parts as a senior. I  
ain't never seen nobody's private parts. I only seen baby private parts or whoever I'm with at  
the time.  
So I'm really over here stressed out trying to figure out how I'm gonna get this person changed.  
Because at the end of the day, of course, you gotta do what you gotta do. I ain't gonna let  
nobody suffer even though I'm inexperienced.  
I got the job done. That was a weakness for me. But I'm gonna move on.  
So we talked about, so on the previous slide, I'll go back because this is gonna lead to the  
second slide. We got these strengths, we got these weaknesses, these opportunities and these  
threats. So here's a solution.  
Leveraging your strengths. You own your home, you have experience in direct care, so promote  
that. Position your home as a family run with low staff turnover, offering personalized attention  
unlike the larger homes.  
Tackle your weaknesses head on. Acknowledge that you are new. When I say acknowledging  
that you're new, acknowledge that to yourself.  
I ain't telling you to broadcast that you a new business owner. Acknowledge within. Because  
we're working on our weaknesses within ourselves.  
This ain't something we gonna put on the front street. Acknowledge that you are new. Build  
trust by offering first look tours to case managers and social workers.  
So basically like open houses. Or after you stage your house, take pictures and send it to them.  
Or do a virtual tour.  
So that's what I mean by the first look. Use your experience in direct care to offer hands-on  
support that more established home may overlook. Market to churches, health fairs, local  
Facebook groups, and low cost and highly targeted.  
So when I say health fairs, this is just merely an example from the previous slide. So let's just  
say for instance, when I did my home care agency, I did a grand opening or a community event.  
I don't remember how I worded it at the time.  
But one of the things that we offered was free healthcare screenings. I'm not a nurse or  
anything like that. So I had Jamicia, my sister, another girl named D'Andrea.Those three nurses, they're RNs, they did my health screenings for me. I was able to advertise  
it, you know that this is something we're doing, to be able to bring in people into the  
community, bring awareness and get eyes on this. But I use my friends and my family to fill in  
those gaps because if I read somebody's blood pressure right now, I don't know if it's  
dangerous.  
If I take their sugar, don't know. I do know the O2, but again, like I said, I'm not healthcare, I'm  
not into that. And even though I got my home care agency, we don't run vitals, it's non-medical.  
So I had to bring in the experts to be able to facilitate that. So if you have those different things  
that you can do, utilize those strengths to be able to tackle those weaknesses. And capitalize on  
opportunities.  
Reach out to rehab centers and hospitals that are frustrated with slow discharge placement.  
Create a simple referral packet and emphasize fast moving readiness, especially for seniors  
with nowhere to go. Hold on, I gotta drink me some more water.  
Now, when you're dealing with social workers. Yeah, I agree, we do. Hold on.  
We're planning to do Margaret, Zendaya, I don't know, Barbara, Faith. When you're dealing with  
social workers, they already have a lot going on. So the more simple your processes are when it  
pertains to getting a new lead or referral.  
You know, if you had them fill out applications and asking for so much from a social worker,  
nine times out of 10, they gonna move around to the one that can get them in and out. You  
know, your assessment process is quick. Your intake process is quick.  
Everything move quickly. And also, another thing is, you know, as business owners, y'all don't,  
now I ain't gonna say y'all, but a lot of times people have businesses and they don't answer the  
phone. Social workers have to call multiple times, leave voicemails, or, you know, go through  
this long lengthy list of different people who say they need their beds filled, but they're not  
answering the phone.  
Imagine how long it takes a social worker to work on discharge planning when you got a bunch  
of group home operators not answering the phone, because they at work and, or, you know,  
they got their phone on silent. Oh, you know, whatever the case may be. If you position yourself  
and say, hey, you know, we have office staff, you know, like my BA, if she missed a phone call  
from one of my businesses, that's her last day.  
And if she do miss it, it better be because she was on another line, or that's her last day.  
Because businesses with business lines should answer the phone. If a social worker gotta beg  
you for a lead, beg you to give you somebody, you'll, if you got that reputation of not answering  
the phone or you got a call back within 24 hours out it, they answer the next person on the list.  
And that's one of the main reasons why placement agencies are about to take over becausewhen group home operators or licensed assisted living facilities don't answer their phone and  
they having to call this whole list, it's so much easier for them to call a placement agency and  
say, hey, I got a guy, you know, this is his medical, this is his income, this is his discharge date.  
And allow that one person to make all of those calls for them. And then now they gotta charge  
you either half the first month rent or the full first month rent or half the first, half the second,  
or I want all these different terms that these placement agencies have all because group home  
operators or assisted living facilities as a whole don't know how to pick up the phone.  
Or a second reason is they're not able to accommodate because we all have different  
accommodations or people who we can't take or who we can't take. And so it's just so much  
easier for them to rely on placement agencies or senior living providers or whatever they call  
themselves to be able to take that case and figure out how to handle that test for them while  
they work on other things. So we just gotta do a better job with marketing before the new wave  
be all these facilities only wanna deal with placement agencies and we all have to start paying  
for these leads.  
So you need to answer your phone. All right, neutralize threats. Instead of competing head on,  
specialize.  
For example, if other homes don't accept veterans or clients with Walker or Oxygen, make that  
your niche. Become the go-to solution for underserved clients. Others are not prepared to  
house.  
Now you do this a little bit in the beginning until you can get choosy. So you don't wanna just  
be the person that is known for taking the leftovers. That's not what I'm saying.  
But this is a way to be able to establish different relationships. And so let's just say for instance,  
you got people who don't wanna take sex offenders or their homes are in areas where they  
could take sex offenders. That's one of the ways that you can neutralize those threats.  
So why do you need SWOT? It helps you stay competitive in a growing industry. Lets you plan  
for growth without ignoring the gaps in your business. Makes it easier to communicate your  
value to referral partners and funders.  
Helps you pivot quickly when regulations change or referrals slow down. It keeps your vision  
clear and your team aligned. All right.  
I'm gonna check on this chat real quick before we go to this next one. You need five or you  
good? You've been going a couple hours. Yeah, let me go and finish that cup of water.  
You've been going, you've been going. Let me finish this cup of water. No, that I guess is what  
she was talking about earlier from a response time perspective.  
Right now when you're looking at your key performance indicators and that is how you  
measure, how well your business is doing. Looking at the numbers, that response time is goingto be one of the most important ones. So what you guys don't realize or may or may not realize  
about a lot of caseworkers, especially if they're like an LMSW, which is a licensed master social  
worker, they have multiple jobs, most of them.  
Because social workers, unfortunately, don't get paid what they're worth all the time. And so  
they have to work. They may work at a hospice center during the day and at a hospital during  
the night, or on the weekends or something like that.  
So that's one thing that you got to realize is that you may be talking to a social worker that they  
have a day job somewhere and then a weekend job somewhere else. So if you can become that  
reliable person for them, you instantly move to the top of their list because you're killing two  
birds for them with one phone call. Knowing that they can come back and speak directly to you  
and get people housed.  
Now, Nat, you made a very, very good point here a couple of moments ago about these  
placement agencies taking over. Guys, until you have a, because I know, especially if you're  
new, a lot of people are going to have this thought process of all the stuff they don't have. I  
don't have a house yet.  
I don't have a website yet. Don't have this yet. I don't have that yet.  
Understand this. Until you get any of those things, you are a placement agent. You're out every  
day.  
Your job is to make money finding referrals. You are a placement agent until you get a house.  
Now, here's another thing.  
When you get a house, you're still a placement agent. And the first place that you place people  
is your house. And if for whatever reason they can't get placed in your house, you make money  
on a referral placing them somewhere else.  
So you never stop being a placement agent because that's what keeps you fresh on marketing.  
That's what keeps you fresh on sales. That's what keeps you fresh in the field is making sure  
that every social worker you come across knows unequivocally that you are a person that they  
can call immediately to get somebody placed in a house somewhere.  
And like for us, if we place somebody, like we don't even charge a referral fee on hours because  
we are building up and looking to come back and do the services from a mental health  
rehabilitation perspective inside a group home. So it's like, we're not looking to charge people,  
but if that's not you, which it's gonna be 99% of the people on here, get really, really, really,  
really good at marketing and becoming a placement agent. Because here's the thing.  
If you can go to a social worker, if you can go to a hospital, if you can go to a nursing home, you  
can go to somewhere, skilled nursing facility, homeless shelter, whatever, and position yourself  
as that placement agent, you are now taking a million of those calls that the social workertypically thinks that they're gonna have to take, are gonna have to make, you're taking that off  
their plate. So no, no, no, you don't have to worry. I'll make those calls for you.  
I have already have the network set up of people and of other individuals that are operators in  
this arena already that I can make sure that you just send me all the information. And once I  
get the information, I'll cast a net out to my people and I'll get back with you. And once we find  
a person, I'll make the connection for you.  
So if you are placing yourself properly in the right position with these social workers, you can  
make sure that your phone is consistently ringing because you're taking something off of their  
plate that they need taken off. They deal with a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff. It's their job to find  
resources.  
It's their job to take care of these people. It's their job to get them connected with the  
resources. It's their job to make sure that the resources follow through and did the things that  
they needed them to do for the people that they're taking care of.  
So if you can come in and say, hey, I can be a problem solver for that and take that off of your  
plate and take three or four things off of your plate that you're typically working with, then  
right there, you're becoming the person. Y'all picking up what I'm putting down right there? Is  
that making sense? Pam, you're talking to the wrong person at the hospital if they're telling you  
that. Like that's, yeah, if they're telling you that they can only work with you if they're accepting  
Medicare or Medicaid, nah, that ain't the case at all.  
You gotta, so here's the thing, guys. If you hear an answer that either doesn't sound right or it  
discourages you, go talk to somebody else because that person that you just spoke with, they  
don't have all the answers. The hospital has many floors and you got many social workers on all  
those different floors.  
If you don't get the answer, you won't. Go to another floor until you keep getting the answer,  
you won't. It's kind of like when you pissed off with AT\&T and you call one customer service  
agent and they don't tell you what they want, they don't fix the problem for you, hang up and  
you call right back and you get somebody else.  
Same thing in this marketing game. So can we charge a hospital for referral fees? Nick gets into  
that at the conference on how you can potentially go about doing that. Some of these answers  
free, some of these answers is gonna not be free.  
But again, like guys, you gotta be relentless. You gotta knock down every single door, go like, I  
don't hear no. And you have to be the same way with this because it's not gonna be the early  
bird that gets the worm.  
It's gonna be the bird that never stops looking for the worm, no matter what. And as long as  
you're that person that is the squeaky wheel, that's always in front of them, that's always  
making sure that they know who you are, that's always making sure that you can putsomething together to solve their problem. And they know that these people are going to call  
you back because I'm telling you, if you're in Fort Worth, just go to the 10th floor at JPS.  
You will see how many people they need on a daily basis. It's never ending. All you gotta go do  
is go sitting around about out there.  
Go sitting around about for an hour and look at all of these people that are not getting picked  
up by family members, but getting picked up by cabs, getting picked up by Uber Health, getting  
picked up by all of these other different vehicles that are not necessarily taking these people to  
a house. Like whenever I was still running my homes, I used to just go sit out there and peep  
game because I just wanted to watch. I just wanted to figure out what was going on, how they  
were doing it.  
I wanted to look at the cab companies that were picking some of these people up and go drop  
cards off to them and say, hey man, if you drop these people off at a shelter or anything like  
that, have them come holler at me. Like if you can bring me somebody and say, hey, if you're  
looking for a house, I can help you out with something. Like there's a million different ways to  
go get it.  
You just gotta be thinking, you gotta be thinking outside the square, outside the circle. You  
can't let yourself be like confined into a shape. You just gotta be thinking all the different ways,  
do common things in uncommon ways.  
Let's see here, what y'all got up here in this chat? Yep, discharged social workers that they do  
set it up. That's just for my Fort Worth people, man. I mean, you can go to Parkland in Dallas,  
you can go to Bentob in Houston.  
I mean, there's no shortage. Any city that has a state-run hospital, it's a state-run hospital  
because these are people that they take them no matter what, have insurance, no insurance,  
doesn't matter. Go find your state-run hospital.  
Go find your county-run hospital, your county-funded hospital, your state-funded hospital. But  
the name of the game is marketing. And like, I hope y'all didn't let that fly over y'all head earlier  
as well when that was talking about, like we partners, but we competitors.  
You know, she's always checking what Will is doing. She's always checking what the next person  
is doing. And it's like, at the end of the day, you wanna make sure that you're not missing out  
on whatever the trend may be.  
You're not, like if it's AI, how can I integrate AI into my business? How can I make it simpler?  
How can I make some of these automated things that we're talking about doing, or some of  
these things that we're talking about doing on here, how can I make them automated? Can I  
put together a system that reaches out to people 50 times a week for me after I initially go out  
and do the work to get their information? If so, what does that look like? You know, I was  
reading an article two days ago about by an engineer who helped put together the Gemini AIfrom Google. And the dude made a hell of a point. He said, right now, the person that you need  
to be the most afraid of is the individual who's learning how to use AI better than you.  
That's the person that you need to be most afraid of, because they are going to take these  
things that we're talking about on this Zoom right here, and they're gonna automate it and  
have something that somebody else doing it a thousand times faster with no breaks, taking no  
breaks. So when you're looking at thinking outside the box, when you're looking at taking those  
opportunities, what does that look like for you? What do you need to say no to in order to say  
yes to something else, to learn something that could help enhance your business today? Like  
take a real good inventory of how you spend your time and look at, okay, if I took an hour away  
from television, from Netflix, from Hulu, from whatever it is that I have a current indulgement  
with, and I put that into learning something that could help me expand my business, that could  
help me go forward. And if I just did that one hour a week, I just gained 52 more hours of  
knowledge and understanding and wisdom and know-how that somebody else didn't.  
They refused to. Hey, brother, Don. My brother, what's going on, Johnny? How you doing, my  
man? I'm good, man.  
I'm exhausted as hell, but I'm good. One of those days, man. Man, I'm looking through the chat  
and this question kind of relates to what you're talking about.  
This person asks, this is Belinda. Is it best for me to build my marketing list before I get a place?  
Yes, oh my God. Belinda, your market, you should never stop.  
You should start this business with building your marketing list and never stop. Never, never,  
never, never stop because you have to realize that in these organizations, like social workers  
change jobs religiously. So just because you may be talking to Jill one week, Jill may not be there  
the next month.  
So you're gonna have to continuously go through this and continuously build your marketing  
list. And you gotta look at the other thing here. Like right now, there is a wave of people  
starting nonprofit organizations to help these underprivileged demographics, especially with  
everything that's going on in the federal government.  
So if you could be on the wave of finding out who some of these people are, are getting them  
on the forefront when they're just now opening or they've been open for about six months to a  
year, but don't really have any big, big traction or big name behind them yet, but they're still  
making moves in the city. Now you're their go-to person. So don't worry.  
Like guys, the house is going to come because you're going to be like you're eventually all this  
stuff is gonna click and you're gonna stop caring what other people think about you. And you're  
gonna stop worrying about public humiliation. And you're gonna stop having a fear of  
everything that you have a fear of and the house is gonna come.  
But in between that timeframe, remember you are a placement agency and your job is to goout market, get referrals, get opportunities, build that marketing list and market to it as often  
as you can. Exactly. I got one more for you, brother Don.  
Go right ahead. And this is a classic also. How do you ensure they pay if homeless wouldn't  
wanna run into any payment issues? Ha ha ha.  
So, I mean, you have a couple of different ways to do that. First is you're gonna be able to, but  
you can look at becoming a payee on their social security, on their SSI. You know, making sure  
that you are a payee.  
If you are not their payee, then you can set up different systems to where you know if they get  
paid on the first or third or the second, third or fourth Wednesday of the month that you're  
somehow, especially if they have it on the card, that you are taking a draft out. So guys, like  
honestly, you can sign these people up for a subscription on Stripe. Like you can set up a Stripe  
account, set up a subscription that is a recurring subscription on there.  
So every month what'll happen is they will draft that out. So set up a subscription on Stripe for  
your business if you want to, and then enter their information. And that way now, if they're  
getting it on their direct express card, now you have that money coming in to you every single  
month on that subscription until you need to take it off because they don't live there anymore.  
But you would want to have it set up to where it's coming in. Like if they get their money at  
12.01 on the third AM on the third Wednesday, I need my money at 12.02. So just, you want to  
look out there. There are multiple systems that are out there that you can utilize and put  
together in order to make sure that you get your money.  
Excellent. I got one more for you, brother Don. Yeah, go far away, man.  
I'm good. This person, and this has countless implications. It says, would that be hurting my  
business by not being able to actually place clients? So they're referring to your earlier  
instructions on marketing before you have a home.  
No, not at all. Because here's the thing. It's like being able to go out to a garden and nobody  
else is in that garden, right? Nobody else is in that garden and you have all the fruit, all of the  
fruit that's possible in that garden.  
You have the ability to go pick all of the fruit that you want to. And so right now, since you don't  
have a basket to hold all of this fruit in, what you're doing is you're gathering as much fruit in  
your shirt as you possibly can, and you're coming out and you're handing out the fruit to your  
friends out that aren't in the garden yet. They don't have access to your garden just yet.  
Then when you get a house, now you got a basket, right? You got a basket to now hold this fruit  
in for yourself. You no longer have to give it away. But by that time, you would have built a  
network of fruit trees so big and planted so many seeds that you can't even take in all of the  
harvest that you're getting.So you fill your basket, and then now you also have to fill your shirt and you go put that, and  
now you go still hand out the rest of that fruit, except you get to continue getting paid for that  
fruit that you're handing out. That's an overflow. You get to get the best pick of the best fruit.  
That make sense? Whoever asked that question? Excellent. You know what, Don, let's make  
sure they understand this. Here's another question.  
Same concept. What do you do, this is Anne. What do you do if the hospital wants to discharge  
to you from your marketing and you don't have a house and don't know anyone else in the area  
to refer them to? So right now, hey, if that's the case, Anne, you're full.  
Hey, I'm full. I'm on a wait list at the moment. Not necessarily on a wait list.  
Say, hey, I'm full. I do have some other stuff coming up. I'm trying to get a house open as  
quickly as I possibly can.  
Let me see what I can do with getting this out to one of my other people. I can't make any  
guarantees, but can I get back to you within the next four hours? Now you're not telling me. At  
that point, I might have to defer them.  
Say, hey, everybody right now for that particular client is full. That doesn't mean anything's  
gonna change with it. Things can't change within the next couple hours or, I mean, couple  
weeks.  
So still keep sending me people. But at that point, you have to defer and just let them know like,  
hey, I've reached out to everybody that I possibly could at this moment. And here's the thing,  
guys.  
It's free to make a post about somebody inside of, that needs a place to stay inside the group.  
Because I can guarantee you this. We, even though we're in there and we're posting different  
things throughout the day and reading different things, we don't necessarily know who has  
what.  
We may see, recognize some of the movers and shakers that's in the group from time to time,  
but we honestly don't know from a day-to-day basis who has what, who just got their house,  
who just opened up for business. They may make a post on there saying, hey, a congratulatory  
post, but because of how the algorithm works, you may not see that post for two days. Like  
that's why you still get people liking your stuff two, three days later, because the algorithm, the  
way the algorithm works, you may not even see a post that somebody makes.  
So you wanna, you just wanna make sure that, you know, post it in the group, post it often, tag  
different people so that they may be able to repost it. And I mean, it might not be a bad idea  
that when you get back home for us. Oh, it might not be a bad idea for us to create a chat just  
for referrals.Well, we got that for on school, but everybody didn't join. Well, there y'all go, get y'all ass on  
school. It's on there for you right now.  
Yeah, hop on school so that you can get on there and see and post the stuff that's on there. And  
guys, here's the thing, you know, real talk. Ron, you, like, I love the technology pieces of things,  
man, because I like just staying on top of technology.  
It's fun to me. It's a very interesting thing. You have to realize that Zuckerberg controls what  
you see and what you don't see, all right? It's fully controlled.  
So if you want to not necessarily be under that control, then you need to get on school, because  
school is the new leader of the free world as far as being able to put everything out. Nick, can  
you put the school link in there? I see Lorraine is just asked for the school link. Okay.  
You guys need to migrate, and I'm not saying get off of Facebook. I'm just saying that some of  
the most important messages that you guys need to see are when you coming up here last  
minute and wondering like, how did I miss this link? Nick, can you post a link real quick when  
she 10 minutes into the Zoom? It's on school. It's on there for you to be able to see.  
And that way, everything that gets posted on school, nothing gets hidden from you. It's already  
all on there. And so it's like, you're able to now be in the know that much quicker.  
Exactly. Stays in school is a new clubhouse minus the voice app. But I mean, you can do  
different voice stuff on there as well.  
So when that gets the link and posted on there, guys, that is how to make sure that you are  
seeing everything that's going on in the group, all the right announcements that's going on in  
the group. Every bit of it, you won't miss it. Currently, I have my LLC, business bank accounts,  
website, cars, and auto things.  
I'm ready to start looking for the home. But the problem is I don't have the money to an open.  
What can I do to get money to start my group home? You can start finding people that need to  
be placed because 10 to 15 placements, if you're charging $300 for them, gets you the money  
to open your home.  
That's one thing that you can do. Don, that's actually a very lucrative business. I have a person  
sometimes that I use, they charge half of a month's rent to place.  
And then on the second month, the other half. So if I'm charging a thousand dollars, they get  
500 the first month, 500 the second month. And when you look at the real estate world, Johnny,  
that's what, I mean, a realtor's charged a one month fee.  
That's their fee for placing somebody in the home. We're just, we're a little bit nicer in charge,  
for the most part, less. I mean, the typical fee is gonna be somewhere between two and $300 as  
a placement fee.Can you unpack referrals and placements? Yes, ma'am, very quickly and very simply for you. So  
guys, from a referral standpoint, let me go look in the group real quick. Let me look in here on  
Facebook and let me find somebody that just posted a referral.  
All right, so I'm looking at a referral and seven hours ago, Ginger, nevermind, that was not what  
I was looking for. All right, on May 1st, Angela Brooks posted, I have a referral in Orlando,  
Florida. It's a male, 37 years old, currently living in a hotel, requesting a private room.  
Income is 9.48 a month. He's diagnosed with ADHD. Said, I have requested move-in fee and  
move-in fee assistance from his case manager for the first month, referral fee applies.  
So Miranda, what's happening is Angela went out and started doing the work to market. From  
her marketing, this case manager for this young man that's 37 years old, living in a hotel in  
Orlando, Florida, reached out to her and say, hey, I have somebody that needs to be in a home.  
Angela said, I don't have a home right now or I don't have space or whatever the reason that  
Angela couldn't take him in her own home.  
She said, you know what? I have a network of people that is 64,000 strong that I can put this out  
to to see if they have availability. And I'm gonna let them know that I'm going to charge a  
referral fee for that. So in the matter of a couple hours, if that long, she had Ursula Johnson say,  
I'll take her if she's still in need.  
Sunshine stated, if he's willing to relocate to Fort Lauderdale, she can get him. And then we had  
a bunch of different people tagging other individuals. So with that, they more than likely were  
able to get this person placed and Angela was able to make whatever her referral fee is, all  
from making phone calls and making connections.  
Guys, let me tell you something. In any business, unless you are Frank Lucas and you going  
directly to the source, there is a high probability that you're gonna be dealing with the  
middleman. And the middleman is the connector.  
I know this person has a need. I know this person has a need and it's my job to bring these two  
together and charge a fee for it. That is unpacking referral and placements.  
You are the middleman until you are the man or woman. I had to go to what I know, sorry.  
Everybody can relate.  
You ain't going down, you ain't there. All right, so- Think about it though, most of our richest  
people are middlemen. Exactly.  
Middlemen, they're the ones that make the money. They are, and they're in and out. They're in  
and out the deal, on to the next one.  
So this- Go ahead, my bad, John. These referral fees for you guys that are on the fence or you  
need funding as you call it, Don just gave you the source of your funding and it's not thatdifficult. And on top of that, what you really don't like, here's the dope part about being a  
placement agent until you can start placing people in your own home is that you are learning a  
skill to be able to place people in your own home.  
Like you are learning the skill that you are going to need to wash, rinse and repeat over and  
over and over again for your own business. Exactly. To be able to continuously fill your houses.  
Miranda MacMillan said, so in my world, a broker. Broker, middleman, connector, whatever  
adjective you wanna use or noun you wanna use to describe them, that's who they are. And the  
plug, there you go, Elizabeth, what's up? I like that one.  
Yeah. That's what they are. That's what you, that's what all of us are if we don't have a house.  
Right. Every last one of us. All right, so non-licensed, I have a landlord that's ready to rent me a  
property.  
Should I try to get it full first or should I just go ahead and pay up and get that house full? Hey,  
Lisa, I would, if you, I would go ahead and take the action and get the house. It's like field of  
dreams. If you build it and you do the work, they will come.  
But if you're trying to wait until you get, you already have a corral full and you can just move all  
eight, 10 or whatever gonna be in there, you're never gonna get started. That's gonna, you're  
gonna continuously utilize that as an excuse as to why you haven't gotten started. Put that  
pressure on, all right? Pressure builds, heat and pressure make diamonds.  
So go ahead and put that pressure on yourself. And so now it's like, oh shit, I got a house. I  
have to perform.  
I have to get out here and market. I have to get up early. I have to leave my five, nine, five and  
go to my five to nine and make sure that I'm doing everything that I need to do.  
All right, I'm ready. All right, you got it. All right, so rural marketing strategy.  
So basically you need to cast a wide net, especially when you're trying to start your business. So  
in the rural areas, they let different services and just like people who are local have to  
experience different hardships or housing challenges or medical challenges or being able to  
have the proper care within their home. The same things go on in the rural areas.  
So you wanna build trust in small communities, word of mouth matters, partner with clinics,  
churches and outreach programs, host informational sessions, join local boards and offer to  
solve discharge problems. All right, so many serious, oh serious, many seniors in rural areas  
lack transportation, internet access and health literacy. Hospital closures and provider  
shortages make it harder for them to get care.  
So hundreds of rural hospitals are at risk. Texas leads in the rural hospital closures and Madera  
Community Hospital, that's a hospital in California that closed leaving 160,000 residents withouta local emergency room. So as these rural areas start facing these challenges where private  
positions and hospitals start closing, that creates more of a need for these individuals.  
So whether it's on the home care side or whether it's on a group home side, there's a need in  
the rural communities. And so part of the reason why these hospitals and let's just say primary  
care doctors are closing is due to the low reimbursement rates. So Medicare and Medicaid do  
not cover the full cost of care, especially in rural areas.  
Staffing shortages, there's not enough nurses and doctors or caregivers to run facilities safely  
or consistently. Unsustainable financial losses, so rising costs, aging, infrastructure and fewer  
paying clients lead to budget shortfalls. And hospital consolidation, larger health systems are  
shutting down smaller underperforming rural hospitals to cut costs.  
So healthcare provider shortages in rural areas. So these are some of the statistics. Primary  
care shortages, physician shortage, projections and rural health worker shortages.  
So like I said, as more of these areas start getting to a point to where they don't have enough  
people to service them, these people start lacking. And so the seniors in those areas are  
suffering silently because of these. And of course with there not being as many resources or  
they're kind of like off the radar or off the grid because they're in rural areas, the major cities  
aren't being exposed to what these seniors are having to deal with or what they're experiencing  
because they're just like off to an island by themselves.  
So as healthcare professionals, whether we're housing them or providing services, we have to  
be marketing in those areas. So if they still have, let's just say like local gas stations or local  
churches or any type of community events or bingo hall or whatever that source of  
entertainment within those communities, you wanna be present in marketing. You can even do  
door to door marketing.  
When it's a small community, a lot of people know each other. And so that's why I made the  
point of in the earlier slide that word of mouth matters. And there are some areas where they  
still have some small urgent care clinics and things like that where you wanna market to  
because as their health start declining, they're gonna need a place to go or they're gonna need  
someone to come in to provide services for them.  
And so high demand, low supply. So these are some of the reasons that you need to consider  
marketing into those rural areas. So fewer hospitals and providers mean people still need care,  
just not from a traditional resource.  
When facilities close or providers leave, you become the alternative. Seniors and disabled  
individuals still need help with meals, hygiene, medication reminders and supervision. So pretty  
much their activities of daily living.  
Fewer hospitals and providers mean people still need care, just not from a traditional source.  
Oh, I doubled it, sorry. So lack of competition.Many entrepreneurs overlook rural areas assuming they're not profitable. This gives you less  
competition and a chance to become the go-to resource. You can dominate the area faster and  
build trust with social workers and discharge planners.  
And the reason why I am saying this is because I got a call from a rural area today and that's  
why this is an addition to what I was gonna talk about initially because I got a call from, it was a  
nursing home and it was in a rural area and they were saying that, of course, I always wanna  
see what the pain points are. The thing about it is there's not many homes in those areas that  
will take people who need to discharge or rehabilitation services. So let's just say for instance,  
like I said, the same challenges that goes on in the local communities happens in the rural  
areas.  
So let's say for instance, in the city of Houston, if someone is doing some spring cleaning, fall  
and break their hip, have to go into the hospital, then be transferred to a rehabilitation center,  
the insurance only covered them for, let's just say 20 days. After the 20 days is over, they are at  
their discharge level. So if it's a rural area and it's a nursing home, they had someone who  
should be able to discharge home on home health to continue their physical therapy, those  
individuals have to either stay in the nursing home to run up their medical bills or their day-to-  
day rates at those facilities due to not being able to have the proper discharge plans in place for  
them.  
And so if those things are happening in the rural areas and people are not being able to  
discharge, that's one of the financial strengths that these rehabilitation centers or nursing  
home are experiencing because by law, they can't discharge them in a unsafe environment or  
not being able to, let's just say for instance, somebody lose their house through all of these  
challenges. So they have to safely place these people. And if they don't have those resources,  
that's the burden that the hospital or the facility has to take on.  
So after getting a call today from like a rural area, because it was a place that I market to, doing  
some cold calling, they had a lady who they needed to discharge. And so I was able to  
coordinate to get her placed because I mean, her level of care was beyond what I could handle,  
but her income was like $1,500 a month or whatever. But of course, these rehab places, most of  
them charge anywhere between four to $6,000 on the low end.  
So being able to keep her there and her insurance isn't covering it, they're gonna be upside  
down to keep her there. And then you have to also understand like these people don't meet the  
medical requirements to be able to be transitioned into a long-term care facility. Now, some of  
these nursing homes try to give these people certain diagnoses.  
The doctors give them certain diagnoses to get them qualified for long-term care insurance.  
Like if they have some mild memory issues, they may have a diagnosis of dementia or  
something like that to keep them, to get certain qualifiers for long-term care. But like, if you go  
in, if one of these seniors just break their hip and they can't really walk anymore, but they may  
could be in a wheelchair or something like that, that don't automatically qualify them for long-term care in these nursing homes.  
So if you got nursing homes in these rural areas, then you definitely wanna make sure that you  
are marketing to them. And I don't know if I went through all these points. So yeah, this gives  
you less competition and a chance to become the go-to resource.  
You can dominate the area faster and be a trust with the social workers and discharge  
planners. So, and this just goes with that saying, if the majority of people are marketing in their  
local communities and leaving out the outskirts or the rural areas, then if you make that your  
duty or your mission to serve those individuals, then you can dominate the area. And also, I  
know a lot of times people say, well, what if they don't wanna move that far away from home or  
these different barriers? Like, let's just say for the instance, cause the reason why I said it is  
because that was one of the issues that was faced with the lady today.  
She did not want to leave her city. And so I had to talk to her and tell her, I said, hey, with your  
condition, nobody in your area is gonna be willing to take you. And I had to let her know that,  
what she had to look forward to in the city.  
And I also explained to her that there are more resources available. She'll be near the city. You  
know, hospitals and eventually to go to the hospital, be around more teams of experts as far as,  
not experts, but healthcare professionals, primary care doctors, home health, being able to get  
physical therapy and things like that.  
So coming into the city in comparison to where she was at, she was gonna lack some of those  
resources. And so sometimes you have to, you know, paint a picture for them to be able to see  
the benefit of leaving that rural area, especially when it's an aging senior who's unable to live  
alone. And then you have to look at, you know, I talk about the emergency response time.  
How long is it gonna take for an ambulance to get to you in comparison, if you come to the city,  
you know, what their response time is. So there are certain things you have to leverage when  
you are going out into the rural areas to get these people to leave where they are. Because of  
course, if people have been there their whole life, that's kind of where they wanna be, but it  
may not be the appropriate place or a safe place for them.  
All right, so of course, overflow from closures. Hospital closing equals more referrals for  
housing and in-home support. Discharge planners are desperate for solutions.  
And if you are ready, they'll choose you every time. Group homes and home care are both  
lower cost alternatives to long-term hospital stays. And so that concludes tonight's Q\&A as far  
as the PowerPoint presentation goes.  
If you are looking to attend the two-day conference, here's the website that you can visit. It's  
pretty much the name of the group, www.grouphomesfornewbies.com. You'll be able to find  
mentorship as well as tickets to the two-day conference. Yeah, so I'ma end this and look at the  
chat and see if anybody here any final questions.Hello, can you hear me? Yes. Hey, good evening, everybody. My name is Kevin.  
First of all, first time on here, great information. I'd love to come back every time you guys do  
this, if you guys still continue to do this. Just real quick, I have a rental house, long-term tenant,  
recently got out.  
Now my tenant is somebody who's turning my house into a group home. But I believe things  
have changed to where at the end of the contract, we're gonna go our separate ways. But I  
looked into it, and I've been thinking to possibly do it myself, turning this house into a group  
home.  
I guess my lease ends at the beginning of next year. I did hear some good advice, and what I  
learned is that I can start marketing now and kind of getting myself out there and kind of  
building the networks and the relationships. But is there anything else you would recommend?  
Somebody finished talking, I'm sorry.  
Oh, wait, yeah, Kevin, repeat what you were saying, because I kind of got, it was some  
background noise. Sorry, yeah, absolutely. No, I was just asking, I was just pretty much trying to  
see, I have to the beginning of next year to start my group home.  
Any recommendations on what to do now to get ready to prepare myself for when I receive my  
house back to rent it out? I did hear stuff about marketing, which sounded great. Anything else  
would you guys recommend? Do you have your digital footprint together, like get your name,  
EIN, your website, your email, your marketing material and things like that? No, no, no, no, no. I  
definitely got to do that.  
Well, that's something you should start working on. Okay, and is that something you guys  
provide? Like what kind of service do you guys provide? Yeah, so we, I mean, if you want to sign  
up for mentorship or go to the conference, we'll, you know, from A to Z, we'll be able to get you  
there. Oh, at the conference as well? Yes.  
Okay, and that's what I think I heard in Atlanta? You got several cities to choose from. Yeah, so  
we have, the next one will be Cleveland, Ohio, which is this weekend. Then we have Atlanta,  
Detroit, Dallas, Chicago, Mississippi, and then North Carolina.  
Got it. Okay, so I didn't hear anywhere in Florida, right? Sorry. Yeah, so Florida, you know, you  
can go to either Georgia or Mississippi.  
Okay, gotcha. Okay, I'll definitely look into that. And that is a good, great first steps to getting  
yourself situated.  
Okay, awesome. And I appreciate you sharing about that school.com. I just signed up for it and  
yeah, it sounds exciting. Kevin, you're the, if I'm hearing correctly, you're the landlord, right?  
Yes, I am the landlord.We had a situation, it's not a bad situation, but I'll give you a quick story. I used to work in  
assisted living facility of 20 residents. I later became a firefighter, but I always had the idea and  
thought that I would love to turn my house into an ALF or a group home.  
And I never did. And then I asked, it's funny enough, somebody sent me a message through  
like zillow.com asking me if I was interested in renting the house to them and they would turn it  
into a group home and I wasn't opposed to it. So I was gonna let them do it.  
And I guess my wife didn't like the way they're handling business with being late on payments  
and et cetera. So now we're just getting the idea, like why don't we go back to what we wanted  
to do and turn it into an ALF or a group home. And so now we're kind of flirting with that idea  
again and trying to talk to the fire alarm and sprinkler system companies and maybe getting  
quotes and we're just trying to, yeah, pave the road.  
Before you put that money into it, I would definitely say go to a conference and learn what you  
don't know because you might end up spending unnecessary money. And from a real estate  
perspective, is this the only house in your portfolio or do you have multiple homes right now in  
your portfolio or what does that look like? I have a few. Yeah, I have a few.  
Because, and the reason I'm asking that is, A, you may not need to put sprinkler systems in  
there, especially if you're going to unlicensed model, which is what we are talking a lot about  
here tonight. There may not necessarily be a need. Right now, is the house that you were  
renting out to a group home operator still currently being rented to them or is that, has that  
lease ended? Yeah, it's still currently, they still, it's still for them.  
Cheryl, can you mute please? Sorry about that. Cheryl, can you mute please? Thank you. Yeah,  
so they do have the house still until the beginning of next year.  
I gave them the option if they wanted to break the contract, I'd be okay with that, but it sounds  
like they've already invested money into it so where they want to kind of get their money back  
and probably make a little bit. So I think they're doing what you guys are talking about, the  
unlicensed, I guess like house sharing or room sharing and then they're probably getting  
people from all sorts of different places. So that's, yeah, that's what they're doing.  
Kevin, if I'm you, and this is me speaking from one real estate investor to another. Yeah. If I'm  
in your shoes right now and I already have somebody running the business out of my home  
and I like the business and I don't like the person running the business, I'm going to see if they  
would just move out, not let by-accounts be by-accounts but they can let everybody stay and  
you just walk into a business.  
Yeah, and that's probably what I think is going to happen. I think it's going to happen. And the  
only thing, the only bad thing with that is that I'll be inheriting the people that they just put in  
there.  
Because obviously it's not their house. So they just want to get the pay. They just want to getpaid.  
So I don't know how good they're screening their people. And that's part of the reason why I  
kind of want them out. At least with me, it's my house.  
I'm going to screen the people better. Right, right. No, absolutely, absolutely.  
And yeah, I mean, a million different ways to go about that, man. Definitely hit up a conference  
bro so we can have more in-depth talks on this because there are a lot of options that you are  
sitting on right now that you don't know that you're sitting on. And a lot of upside to that as  
well that is going to allow you to step into this industry three legs up as opposed to just feeling  
like you're just getting started in a certain aspect of it.  
And then with the background that you already have, you can use some of those previous  
connections that you've had from different work experiences to help fill your house up a little  
bit quicker. Now, on top of that, what I want to ask here, and this is going to be you giving value  
to other people on here that may be a little bit afraid to come and talk to a landlord or not know  
what to say. What are some key triggers that you want to hear from somebody that's  
potentially looking to come and rent a property from you for this type of business? Yeah, I just  
want everybody to know that it's one of those things that I think everybody can relate to it.  
If you don't know about a certain thing, like I'm going to give somebody like a crazy question. If  
I told you guys, hey guys, let's invest in a cryptocurrency. I think most of you guys would be like,  
nah, I'm good.  
And most of the time, the reason is you guys go straight to no, it's because it's the unknown.  
You guys don't know about it, so it's easier and it sounds safer just to say no. So what I would  
advise to everybody is that if you're going to landlords and sending those text messages or  
calls, sound professional and just realize that the person on the other side of the phone is most  
likely ignorant of what group homes are.  
And yeah, that's pretty much what it is. They're ignorant about what group homes are or even  
the unlicensed part of it, right? And it would be your job to educate them and just to basically  
reassure them that what you're doing is safe and it's not illegal and not even just that, but also  
you're providing a good to the community. And I would just say it's just educational.  
So the more you understand what you're doing and you can educate the person on the other  
side of the phone and just create a good contract and make sure that you're doing everything  
you can to reassure your landlord and provide them the sense of security. So for everybody  
that continuously asks us the question, what do you say to landlords? A landlord just told you  
what he wants to hear and what most landlords want to hear. And the way that Kevin put it, I'm  
going to put it in another frame for you, okay? A confused mind always says no.  
Yep. All right, plain and simple. A confused mind always says no, which is exactly why I was very  
targeted in asking Kevin that question because I knew where the answer was going to comefrom.  
I knew what was behind there, but you guys hear from us all the time. So I wanted y'all to hear  
from somebody new that's actually doing it to somebody else, letting somebody else rent out  
on it and exactly what they want to hear. Ned, back to you.  
I'm sorry. Kevin, I appreciate you, brother. Really quick, the only thing that is making me kind of  
want to get rid of them sooner than later is that a lot of the stuff that's happening, they just  
keep coming with excuses and excuses and nobody wants to hear excuses.  
You want to see results. So that's kind of the part where I'm kind of like, you know what, I want  
to get past this and then I want to start my own and do it myself and do it the right way. There  
you go.  
Yeah. Thank you, Kevin, man. We appreciate it.  
We got it, guys. Appreciate everything you guys are doing. The net effect strikes again.  
Uh-oh. We got new landlords in here getting ready to kick out tenants so they can start the  
business. Yeah.  
Anybody else got any questions? I had a question. Okay. So I went to a real estate investing  
meetup about two weeks ago and I met this guy who's a real estate investor and he has 10  
homes that he actually uses kind of like a group home model, but he uses as a, he doesn't get  
like SSI people, but he uses like living, like professionals who just rent the room and they rent it,  
I think he said weekly, like 160 to $165 a week.  
And at this point he basically offered to give me the 10 homes and he wants like $3,000 a piece  
as basically the rent. I could keep some of the tenants, some of the tenants have been there for  
nine to 10 years and then some of his homes are like completely empty. So I would have to, I  
guess, you know, find my own tenants at this point, but I'm kind of trying to do the market  
analysis, kind of like what you discussed today and see in my market, you know, how much I  
could charge because he's asking for $3,000 per house and just doing the math, it's not much  
of a profit margin for me.  
So I'm a bit confused on if I should take, like he's kind of ready to kind of wash his hands and  
not deal with like the tenants and anything like that. And it's fully furnished as well. Okay, so  
you're stepping here into a couple of different things.  
One, you have a market analysis, it's his. You have a 10 year market analysis. And so if I'm in  
your shoes, I would first ask to see what a P\&L looks like from one of the houses that he's going  
to continue to allow you to have the tenants that are currently in there.  
What are those tenants currently paying? Have you, did you ask him that? Yeah, so that tenant  
is paying 165 a week. A week, okay. So all of them pay that, pay, sorry, the ones that have beenthere for nine to 10 years all pay that rate.  
He's never changed their rate. They've paid that for 10 years. All the other tenants that move,  
like, you know, that are like there, like the newer people, he charges between 180 to 185, but  
everybody pays less than 200\.  
It's just the tenants that have been there the longest, he's just kept them on a steady, steady  
rate. Don. Take it.  
I think the first thing she should have attempt to ascertain is what is his pain? Because from just  
hearing her, there's some pain there, right? Tired landlord. Yeah, he's a tired landlord. So I  
would have, my, the way I would have approached that is a partnership, but I would have  
approached it, I would have dug a little bit deeper to see if he would be willing to still gain a  
check for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years, right? 20 years.  
Yeah, still get a check for 20 years, if not more, right? But 20 years, certainly 20 years. And I  
would have been asking him about owner financing because if he has 10 houses and he's tired,  
let me take them over as an owner. So I would have been asking about owner finance.  
I would have been trying to figure out if he had mortgages on him so I could do a sub two.  
They're all paid off. He's a really big real estate investor in Charlotte.  
So I kind of tried to figure out what his pain points were and he didn't really have any. These  
houses are like fully owned. He's paid pennies for them.  
Some of them, like people, he's, some of the people, like somebody, he bought the house for  
like a Coke and a Reese's Pieces. Like some people have just wanted to get rid of the homes.  
His, he didn't have any pain points when we discussed it.  
His perspective was more so like, I have more than enough real estate. I have a really big  
portfolio. I don't really care, you know, to be dealing with this too much.  
Like I just rather get a monthly payment and not have to do any, you know, property  
management, basically. Did you ask him about- This is a perfect setup. Yeah, did you ask him  
about being, him receiving a monthly payment while allowing you to finance ownership,  
finance the homes from him? No, because I honestly, I mean, you brought up a really good  
point.  
I really didn't think about that. I didn't really think about the aspect of like taking over the  
homes or like owning the homes. He was, the option that, really the conversation we had was  
more so like taking over the business, not the homes.  
I didn't really think too far into it, to be honest. Okay, let me say this, right? Because this is a  
very valid, I mean, a very good point you just brought up, taking over the business. And this is  
why I am, and others, Don, Dion, and myself, we're like strong advocates about owning theproperties and not so much as arbitraging, because then if I asked you, if I wanted to sell the  
business, but still maintain my real estate, I could do that in the long run, right? And so with  
him, my approach as an investor, I don't just want the business.  
I want the real estate. That's the most important aspect of it for me anyway. So even if, so when  
we're talking about taking over the payment, let's just say, as Don said, you have his market  
analysis, you have his rent rolls, you have his P\&Ls, right? And even if those numbers are a little  
bit on the higher end I'm willing to pay that because every payment is being paid into equity  
now and not so much as I'm just paying rent.  
So that would be the conversation I would have because it sounds like he's a tired landlord. Like  
you said, he doesn't care. So he would probably be willing to sell you these properties.  
And even if they're at a little higher than market value, I would still buy them because I would  
give him his price, but he would have to give me my terms. My terms, 100%. Yeah.  
And if I'm negotiating on those houses that have nobody in them right now, I am negotiating  
six months, no payments. Six months to a year, no payments on those because I'm gonna give  
you your price but I'm negotiating six months to a year of no payments while I ramp the  
business up and get those full. And from that aspect of things, now that gives me time to not  
necessarily have to worry about that portion of the mortgage so I can focus on the marketing  
side to get people in there that I know are gonna pay the rent that I need to pay.  
And it allows you also while doing that, the time to increase rents on the people that you still  
need to increase rents on that are currently paying such a cushy amount. But on top of that as  
well, now with the ownership side of it, you're getting appreciation from the property whenever  
they appreciate. Now, from a tax perspective, you're able to claim depreciation on these  
properties because I can tell you right now, he's depreciated the hell out of these properties.  
He probably has no more depreciation left in. And so that's why he's just willing to walk away.  
These properties are no longer from a tax benefit, benefiting him the way they once were for  
27 and a half years.  
And so you are coming in at a great time where you have a tired landlord who doesn't  
necessarily wanna do the business model anymore that also is no longer getting depreciation  
from these properties. So a portion of the tax benefits are continuing to go down for him and  
not be as advantageous anymore. And it sets up the perfect storm for you to be able to step in  
and get a really good deal and a really good start on not just the business, but also on a real  
estate portfolio that is going to benefit you for years to come.  
So, okay, so in the case that he's not really willing to leave the homes and he just wants to do  
the business side, you guys mentioned having a 20-year partnership. What exactly do you mean  
by that? Is it just we're going like not necessarily 50-50 or anything like that, but like, what do  
you mean by a partnership if I wanted to work with him in that sense? Well, I'll come in andstart running the business. You still keep the real estate side up, but I'm not gonna pay you  
$3,000.  
We're gonna split profit. We're gonna figure out a, we're gonna figure out what you would want  
to make kind of base. So let's say that that looks like $1,700 a month, right? And let's just say  
that that was quote unquote your mortgage on the property.  
So everything after $1,700, we split profit on. Okay. You still get your quote unquote mortgage  
because you are the bank, but now we're gonna work.  
So now what that does is that that gives you an extra $1,300 to start working with from a profit  
standpoint and actually $650 whenever you're looking at the split, but only if it makes sense.  
Now you come in here with the mindset that I'm 50-50 owner in this business and I am a  
property manager that needs to come in and raise rates because the management that's been  
going on in these properties has been letting it run amok. And even, and what I mean by that is  
they have not, the management that's been in place has not done what we needed to do, which  
is raise rates with the times.  
So these people, of course these people aren't going anywhere. They're gonna stay there. I'm  
paying $165 a week.  
That's $660 a month. Of course I'm not going anywhere else. That is not market value anywhere  
right now within that area for the most part.  
That's gonna be anything from a class B to a class, you know, low class B to low class A living  
arrangement. So if I'm thinking about that, then my mindset in this sense is I have to market. I  
have to get people that are willing to, that are gonna be willing to come in and at least pay $195  
to $205 per week or $750 to $800 per month or whatever that looks like that allows me to get  
the prices up to make this worth it for me.  
Now, what I am doing every single month, if you think that I'm not whispering in this dude here  
to sell me the business, to sell me the houses on owner finance, like, hey man, instead of just  
doing this, just let me just give you a check overall. We not split anything. You just take the 1700  
and wash your hands of it all together.  
And you might have to lean on the fact that, hey, I'm trying to get started in my real estate  
business. So you go to him from a mentor, mentee aspect and say, this would be a great, a hell  
of a start for me and a hell of a leg up to get me started on my real estate journey. Because at  
the end of the day, what you must realize, ma'am, is that you are not a group home operator.  
You are a real estate investor using group homes as an exit strategy. Okay. Yeah, we definitely  
discuss those people.  
How many beds do you have in there? Say it again. You even know how many beds he has?  
How many beds you're paying for for him to come up with $3,000? So the house- Do you knowthat as well? Yeah, so one of the houses that I actually visited was initially a three bedroom  
house that he converted into a five bedroom house. And so there was about eight beds in there  
because one of them was a private room, but you can convert that one private room into 10  
beds.  
All the rest of his houses are between five to six bedrooms. So it would be between 10 to 12  
beds in each house, unless you do private rooms. Okay.  
There's opportunity. Yeah. It's just not, I mean, it's just like, again, this is like whenever you're  
looking at a multi-family where they have not, you know, the owner is not calling him a  
slumlord, but the owner is comfortable.  
They don't have a mortgage on the property, so all they got to pay is taxes and maintenance.  
And because of that, they don't care about raising rates. What they care more about is keeping  
somebody that's consistent on payment as a tenant in the house.  
And that's exactly what he said. His biggest thing is retention. He doesn't, his biggest thing is  
retention because he just wants someone to be giving him money because like you said, the  
houses are paid for.  
He's paid nothing for it and they're paid off. So to him, it's just making some money rather than  
making like a major profit to pay the mortgage and pay everything else. Exactly.  
Man, I mean, I would, if I'm you, Mikel, this is your neck of the woods over there, my man. I  
would get with Mikel and y'all kind of go in together as far as knowing what to say, how to say  
it, and what needs to be said to this guy because this is what I know about guys like that  
because I've dealt with them. I've bought houses from guys just like this all over the country.  
They have the right words and the right phrases that they're looking for. And if you say it and  
present it in the right way, they will sell you the houses without a doubt. You just, everybody  
has a number.  
You just got to figure out what the terms look like. And being that he's been in the game this  
long, I can almost probably guarantee you that he's also bought properties like this in a  
creative financing way. Yeah, all of the houses he bought with creative financing is what he  
said.  
None of the houses he bought. Traditionally? No, he didn't buy any of them. Like I said, some of  
them, I know that the house I specifically went to go look at, that five bedroom that I was just  
discussing, the woman, it was her and her husband.  
And to my understanding, when he explained it, they were trying to get him to get like  
Medicare benefits. And because they on paper made too much money to get the benefits, they  
had to sell the home. So he asked them, what were you willing to sell it for? And they literally  
said a can of Cokes and two boxes of Reese's Pieces and that's what he bought it for.Okay, not to put anything out there. Send me a PM with this guy's name. I think I know who  
you're talking about.  
Yeah. Don't put it on, don't put it in the group. Send me a PM with his name.  
Yeah, I'll send it to you. Because I think I know who you're talking about. Yeah.  
But yeah, I mean, look, here's the thing. If it's somebody like that, this dude's been in the game  
for a minute. So he's been around the block, he's negotiated different terms, all different types  
of ways.  
So he's going to respect the fact, if you come to him and say, hey, let's talk terms. All right, let's  
talk terms on this. I'm interested in the business, but that's secondary.  
I'm interested in doing more of what you do for primarily and utilizing this as an exit strategy,  
just as you have. And you know, just as well as I know that this would benefit me and my  
journey a whole lot more to be able to take over ownership of some real estate. Yeah, yeah.  
That's why I kind of, if you do know who this person is, I sent you the name. Yeah. I know  
exactly who it is.  
Yeah, so he's huge. So, okay, him and I are in a private mastermind together. Okay, yeah.  
I know exactly who it is, yeah. Yeah, so he's not the biggest like, that's why I was saying, he's  
not a tired landlord. That's not the case.  
It's just for him, it's a, it's. He's, let me tell you something. Like, there's some knowledge.  
Yeah. Knowledge, knowledge, knowledge in that guy's head. Yeah, he's a genius.  
We meet up every Tuesday whenever I have availability to go to the real estate meetups, but  
every time he's there every week, but I've definitely connected with him and the woman who  
also owns that meetup. I'm not sure if you know her, but she's also really big as well. Yeah, I did  
not.  
So when you, yeah, that's, when you kept describing what you were describing, I'm like, man,  
I've heard some of these stories before. Mm-hmm. Okay, yeah, I mean, you're, I'm talking like  
millionaire several times over.  
Yeah. Several, several times over. Yeah.  
Yeah, you're not dealing with a small fish at all. No, and that's kind of why I wanted to bring this  
to y'all's knowledge, because this is not someone I could just merely have a conversation with  
and, cause he's a tired landlord, like this is someone who wants to make some type of money  
off of it. So that's why I'm not a hundred percent sure if he'd be willing to sell me the houses  
unless he's making top dollar on it.But I know he would be open to partnership possibly. Yeah, you, I mean, knowing what I know  
about him, it's gonna, I would present it. I would not shy away from presenting it at all because  
I'm not going to ever, but you, yeah, you're gonna have to come with your A game and really  
present something that's gonna make sense.  
Because like I said, this is a well in his area when it comes to real estate. So real estate is big,  
but it's small. You know who the major, major players are that, like, you may not see their  
names on TV or social media or anything like that, but you like, they're in all the right rooms if  
you can get in those rooms.  
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.  
So, shoot me, shoot both me and Michaela Deon offline. Okay. Instagram is best or Facebook?  
I'll put my, I'll put my Instagram for me.  
I don't check my Facebook as much as I need to. Okay. Don, I'm definitely interested in knowing  
who this is.  
And Deon may even know. Deon should know if he doesn't already. Yeah.  
If they're in North Carolina, Deon goes to a lot of the meetups up there. Yeah. This is, Deon  
should know him though.  
He definitely should. I think I might've seen Deon at a meetup cause I also pitched it to a  
meetup and that's kind of how Jay and I, where we connected. He's outside now and I'm waiting  
on him to come in.  
So, I'll ask him when you come in. Okay. But here's the thing for everybody else that's on here  
that has just been listening in on this conversation.  
All right. These are the types of conversations that you aspire to get to. Like, from an aspect of  
the group home side of things, all of us are in the group home industry secondarily.  
All right. Secondarily. Secondary, I don't know.  
Secondarily is a word, my bad. Primarily, we are in the real estate world. Utilizing group homes  
as an exit strategy.  
Okay. An exit strategy for those that don't know is simply a way for us to make money off the  
real estate. So, exit strategies look like group homes.  
Exit strategies look like long-term rentals. Exit strategies look like midterm rentals. They look  
like Airbnbs.  
They look like all of those things of how a real estate investor makes money off of the property  
that they own. Okay. Group homes is a type of exit strategy.All of the things that you heard me mentioning earlier about appreciation, depreciation, the tax  
write-offs that you get as a result of it, that's why we get into this industry because we're in the  
real estate industry. Utilizing group homes as an exit strategy. And what you want to do is  
begin to change your mind to start thinking like that.  
Every single person that you assist with getting in your home is one of your tenants. Now, we  
call them different things, but at the end of the day, if you're thinking about this business with a  
business mind, that is how you're looking at it. You just happen to be serving a higher purpose  
for that person in that person's life.  
That's what you're doing. You're serving a higher purpose within that person's life. And I want  
you guys to pay attention to what is going on right now in everything that is being stripped.  
If you think that this service is not going to be needed 10 times over because it's going to get to  
a point where it's not just affecting the poor, it's also going to get to a point where the middle  
class and the low middle class is affected just as much. And they are going, especially single  
individuals in the low to middle middle class. They are going to be the ones that are the newly  
affected because the more and more that social programs get taken away, here's what's going  
to be your indicator.  
Go talk to the people at these food banks and understand how many people are now starting to  
pull up and check in at the food bank. But when you go outside, they also drive the 2003 Lexus.  
Pay attention.  
Okay, so what this is telling you is life used to be good at one point. Now they may be living on  
a fixed income or a much lower income. Now they're getting to the point where they're getting  
priced out of their style of living or of the life that they once had.  
And so now things have changed for them. And they're having to go in there and look and feel  
uncomfortable because they're in a place that they've never been before and it's only getting  
worse for them. How do I know this? Because I work in a food bank every Friday with my  
mental health clinic.  
I see the people. I see the people that I know whenever they're coming in that they're used to  
coming into a food bank. And I see the people that this might be their first time and they're  
confused as hell and feel out of place.  
And so the more and more that you are looking at problems that are around you, the more you  
see opportunity. Not opportunity to take advantages of somebody but opportunity to think  
more like a businessman while also, or a business woman while also simultaneously providing a  
service to those that need it most. Guys, there's so much to pick up from what we're doing.  
Like if y'all don't get it, all you gotta do from day to day is just watch net but don't watch it while  
sitting on your ass. Go be taking action. Watch her.If you see her working, you be at working while watching her so that you know how to mimic  
and know how to imitate exactly what's going on and what's being done. That way you can now  
start taking action while seeing action and start seeing the results of that action. Like most  
people want lottery success.  
I'm here to tell you right now, that ain't coming. It's not coming. And if you live in Texas, you  
only got till 2027 for them to even try to win the lottery because they snatching it away because  
of all the BS that's been going on.  
So get that part of it out of your head. Create your own lottery. Every day that I wake up at 4.30  
and get ready to go to the gym, I'm putting one more ball in my lottery number that's going to  
make sure that I hit the jackpot.  
Create my own. I ain't worried about anybody else or a lucky ticket or a dollar, $2 making me a  
couple million. I'm putting together the habits that are going to get me the actions that are  
going to get me the results to allow me to live every day exactly how I want to live.  
And you have to be willing to do the same thing. Don't expect anybody to give it to you. Don't  
want anybody to give it to you because if somebody can give it to you, they can take it from  
you.  
But here every week, you're getting free knowledge that you can go and do whatever you want  
with, however you want to do it in whatever fashion that you want to do it. And the only  
difference between the haves and have nots is this group is work ethic. That's it.  
That and not being afraid to ask questions. But we are already discussed that on Sunday of why  
you're afraid because it's not fear of failure. It's fear of public humiliation.  
You don't want anybody to think, I don't give a damn who thinks I'm dumb if I'm asking a  
question because I don't care what people think of me. And you have to be the same way. The  
only person that I care about who think like is me and God, that's it.  
Everybody else, it doesn't matter. So that allows me to ask anything. That allows me to not feel  
humiliated.  
And that allows me to not be afraid of failure because failure most of the time, people put  
failure or correlate failure to what somebody else may think of them. That's what it comes  
down to. You put it based upon what somebody else may think.  
And I'm here to tell you the moment that you stop caring is the moment that you take more  
action. I think it's not so much of that, Mr. Rich, for a lot of people. Go right ahead.  
That's what I thought, but I think it's more of the factor of jumping off the porch, especially in  
times that we are in right now. Because I've been following Ms. Nitz's page for a while, at least a  
year. And thank you for the message tonight.And also for her, she messaged me and asked me, just to just being curious, like why have I  
been to one of the conferences? I've been watching and I comment sometimes on the page,  
but my thing is, see, I have all that you say. I have the LLC. I haven't been doing too much with  
it.  
I'm an inactive realtor. So I know the ins and outs. I'm a loan, I've done loans before.  
I was a processor. So I know the ins and outs of being in the real estate side too. But there's a  
lot of money, there's a lot of money exchanged.  
And some people aren't sitting on that kind of money. You know what I'm saying? Just to be  
saying, I'm gonna invest $10,000 and then I have to wait for the residual. But my personal  
aspiration, because I take care of my mother also, now, when she got COVID two years ago, her  
health declined.  
So now I'm building her back up. This was a good idea for me. But even doing the numbers,  
crunching the numbers, I'm thinking, should I leave my job? I'm almost ready for retirement to  
do this because I'm part-time taking care of my mom.  
And then I'm thinking, okay, I can go get a house tomorrow. That's not the house. It's paying  
the mortgage.  
It's making sure that I have people to feel in the house, the house that I might wanna feel. But  
not only that, I'm reading online, on Facebook, a lot of individuals are asking questions like  
food. Food is expensive these days.  
How do we factor that in? But like you say, I guess that comes with the knowledge of going to  
the conference and all that stuff. Just the mortgage. And then you have taxes on these houses if  
you wanna own them.  
That completely increase all the time. It's just a lot of ins and outs. I think the factor for me is,  
it's not that I can't get the money or get my hands on the money.  
I don't wanna go into debt trying to make money. Does that make sense? When I have- Not to  
me. Huh? And I'm a not to me.  
Oh, okay. You know why? Why? And here's the thing, Angie. I appreciate everything that you  
said.  
Do you know my alter ego? What is it? It's called the attitude alchemist. Yeah. And you just  
triggered it.  
Yeah. Okay, you just triggered it. But I'm glad because I actually, one of my houses I actually,  
and this is private, but I don't mind sharing it.  
I just had to do a hemlock to get out of debt by taking part time off my job when my mom wassick. Okay. I had to pull out my equity on one of my house.  
So I know what it is to like have the money and be scared and be like, I don't wanna lose my  
house if I don't pay this loan back. It's not, people say, oh, it's so easy to get your credit. I don't  
wanna destroy my scores.  
I don't wanna borrow money and then have mortgage payments on top of the fact that I have  
to pay for all these other fees that might. And I'm not trying to be optimistic. You know what I  
mean? Because I love that.  
You're not. I'm on this page to learn. I'm just like, when I sit down and do the numbers, I'm like,  
these numbers aren't numbering.  
Unless you get like a facility, like more than five or 10 people. If you wanna do like a small one,  
maybe like me, I would do probably like no more than three people, three or four people, and  
I'll be good. But I'm saying that will probably just pay the mortgage on the house that I would  
get.  
I still have to get paid too. I still have to survive. You know what I'm saying? So for me, I'm like,  
how could this work for me? Dawn, let me say something.  
I guess that's your word. For one, listen, I mean, we go into debt to make money, right? And  
that's the best way to make money is by going into debt. But you have to go into debt knowing  
like, even when you spoke about the HELOC, the difference between you and an investor with a  
HELOC is that we would have probably, we would have taken out enough money to take care of  
mom, but also having been prepared to invest the difference into something else that was  
going to generate and make that money back to pay off what we spent on mom, right? That's  
one thing.  
So we're constantly looking for- But the thing about a HELOC, and not to interrupt, let's take in  
mind though, with these HELOCs, they have fluctuating interest rates. It's not a point of not  
paying it back. Listen, listen.  
It takes years, but you have to understand how the interest rates- Understand this, right? There  
are times I have different investors that some charge me 12% annually, some charge me 15%,  
some I even negotiate at 50%. It just depends on the deal. It's just, it depends on the deal,  
right? And so- You're saying more so with investors and private lenders then, right? Not with  
the banks per se.  
Is that what you're saying? Listen, I use the bank. Let me give you a scenario. My partner is  
sitting here and he'll tell you, there's been times when I've used my own personal credit cards  
to do deals and my credit score dropped from a 760 to a 520 because I maxed them all out in  
two or three- Oh my God, I would die, right? I know you would.  
You're on the spot, yo\! And I would invest those credit cards, use those credit cards to fund theflips. And when I paid the credit cards back in six months, seven months, or whatever those  
deals may have been, I also walked away with another 120, $130,000 in profit from using the  
credit cards. So I'm not afraid of having, I mean, that's not preferred because I prefer to  
operate on the business side, in terms of credit.  
But if I had to drop my credit score to, if I had to drop my credit score tomorrow to a 400,  
knowing that in six months, I'm going to make $120,000, my credit score going to be a four, my  
credit score going to be 400\. I promise you that. But that's not- 405\.  
Yeah, oh yeah, 405\. That's not something that I would recommend to somebody, someone that  
doesn't know what they're doing in terms of that. I would definitely not recommend that.  
But if you have some experience, then, I mean, I said all that to say that basically we go into, we  
don't mind going into debt to make money. And we're not concerned about interest rate. We're  
just concerned about the return, right? Yeah, the cashflow.  
What is the cashflow? What's our exit strategy and what's the cashflow? So, and what's the  
return? So we're concerned, that's all we're concerned about. It was something else I was about  
to say, but I forgot. Go ahead, Don.  
Angie, you gave me 17 reasons why this wouldn't work. I need two reasons why it will. No, I'm  
not saying it wouldn't work.  
I'm not saying that it could work. Well, you did though. No, no, I'm not, no, no, please.  
I'm not, no, no, what I'm trying to say, I'm just a realist. Like we talked about it. I did the  
numbers, it's like.  
Mm-hmm. And what, so, okay. It just, that's why I'm on the fence.  
It's just like. Here's the thing, we're gonna have a spirited conversation and don't take any,  
don't take anything. That number's hard to number it.  
Don't take anything I say personally, okay? Yeah. Don't take anything I say personally. No, no, I  
won't.  
But I want to, I want to give you a mindset check for just a moment. Yeah, please. Just a  
moment.  
Yeah. Okay, so let's rewind back for a moment, okay? Leslie, I'm gonna call you in and just, as a  
matter of fact, don't, Leslie, come on in. Let's, because you've been sitting there patiently  
because this is gonna, there's a lot of more people in here like you, Angie, and I want to make  
sure that we get everybody in with what I have to say, because I've been taking notes.  
You caused me to start taking notes. So, Leslie, what you got? My heart is really touched. And  
yeah, because she's taking care of her mom.I'm listening to you all. And do you want to know where I am? I'm at work. My client is 95\.  
I'm watching her on a monitor. And guess what else I have on the side of me? I'm gonna read,  
it's just, it's small, but it's powerful. It's from Job 8 and 7\. Though thy beginning was small, yet  
thy latter end should greatly increase.  
That's Job 8 and 7\. Now, I've been hearing bank. I've been hearing numbers. Guess what? I may  
sound crazy.  
I may sound silly, but I had to tell myself, I am the bank. I don't care what it look like. I don't  
care what it sound like to someone.  
I am the bank. All day. All day.  
I asked God, I begged him. I said, what is it? What is my problem? I'm gonna tell you what my  
problem is. Talking about numbers, I'm talking about myself.  
I'm not judging anyone, just me. Leslie, you know this model. You've been her.  
And I think, I think before Annette was born, I was the caregiver. I was the direct care worker in  
the group home. So what Annette is saying, I know this.  
Because before she was born, I was that direct care worker. So what she's talking about is true.  
So then that tells me something.  
I can do it. It's not my business how. It's not my business, but nobody is gonna tell me, Leslie,  
wait a minute.  
The numbers, the math ain't math. I don't care, Ann. What? I got God on my side and that's  
what my problem was.  
I was looking at everybody else, watching everybody else movement. Oh, people was passing  
me. No, you're not.  
I know how to catch up. I know how to surpass. I do.  
And as long as I have strength, I know how to sell dinners. I know how to do that. I know how  
to do more caregiving.  
I know how to do that. I told my client's daughter, I said, listen, I have to tell you something. I  
used to work.  
I was working the midnight shift. My oldest son is 35\. That's how many years I've been  
caregiving.  
I mean, that's how many years I've been caregiving on the night shift. I've been taking care of  
this 95 year old woman on a day shift. I said, listen, if you all need a night shift person, I'm her.Because I know what that means. That mean increase. I said, I hope your mom never need me  
to work at night.  
That means her situation has to go to the left. Declined. But it has to decline, thank you.  
But I'm her. And guess what happened? And I have mixed emotions. I said, Leslie, come on  
now.  
You didn't ask God to make her wait. She's 95\. She's 95\.  
She's not feeling her best. So she need 24 hour care. But I guarantee you, I was standing right  
there.  
Listen, you move those 40 hours and you give me 20 more. So right now I'm working 60\. You're  
not gonna tell me, Leslie, it doesn't make sense.  
Yes, it does. That's my increase. And guess what else I did? And I'm gonna land my plane  
because I don't wanna take up you all's time.  
You're okay. You're flying well. I live in a two bedroom apartment.  
I said, I'm gonna tell you, Leslie, how you're gonna do it. You're gonna get yourself out of your  
master bed, put yourself in your smaller bedroom, and you're gonna put two beds in that  
master bedroom. And I did.  
And guess what? When I wasn't talking, when I was paying attention, I was silent. I got  
everything I need for my two guests. And those proceeds is gonna go to the next place.  
I already know where it is. I know how many bedrooms. They told me I need three times the  
rent.  
And guess what I said? Okay. And I didn't have it, but I got it now. And guess how? I wasn't even  
looking.  
And I wasn't calculating. I stopped calculating. But now the increase, I surpassed that.  
That rent is 2,000. That rent is 2,000. I didn't have the three times.  
I had almost. So I said, okay, son, I got four sons. They all grown.  
One of y'all gonna come with me. And then we're gonna make it make sense. Now I told my  
son, guess what, son? And now with the increase, I don't need nobody.  
I don't need nobody to prove that I have the three times the rent. Not because I'm so special.  
It's because I asked God, I begged him, Lord, if this is me, let it be me.  
You didn't ask. Hold on, now. You didn't ask.You pretty much told God. I begged him. And you went out though.  
But you see, you had faith, but you didn't neglect the works. I did not. And I got myself a  
storage room.  
I said, Leslie, because you're buying stuff now, what are you gonna do? I got a storage room for  
business. My stuff is there. Nobody is gonna tell me nothing about what I can't do.  
I was already laughed at because it didn't make sense. My son's not, they didn't laugh. I'm  
talking about somebody else who just don't understand the business model.  
Now, she wanna know, wait a minute, Leslie, why are you looking like that? Why are you looking  
like that? Why are you looking like Dearest Hope? Well, I keep smiling because you keep talking  
to me about hunger, you're hungry, you're hungry. Leslie, I know you hungry. No, I'm not, girl.  
I stopped eating that expensive food. I'll tell you, peanut butter and jelly or crackers or nothing.  
I don't care.  
I need to fast and pray. I need to fast and pray. I'm telling you, you can do it.  
Leslie, you had a mindset shift. And in the midst of having that mindset shift, it allowed you to  
not care what anybody else thought, put your blinders on and go after what you knew was  
yours. Angie, you had, Angie, let me, Blake, please come back with us, unmute.  
And understand, Leslie, thank you. Because a lot more people than just Angie needed to hear  
the changes that you were willing to make in order to get what you desired. And Angie, you can  
put, let me tell you something.  
The numbers, if that's what you're relying on are not always gonna make sense. They're not.  
Here's the thing.  
If I have enough conviction in what it is that I want to do, I don't need the numbers to make  
sense. I need me to believe in it. Because I know if I believe in it enough.  
I guess if it was just me and I was younger, like you said, I've been in real, I'm inactive right now  
because now I'm working, I work for the city. So I've been working in the city for a long time  
now after I became inactive. I still do, I'm still a realtor, but I'm just inactive right now.  
But to make a long story short, I've had homes. I've had rental properties. I've sold them all.  
If it was just me that didn't, just had to be, I just had to rely on myself, just take care of me. But  
now I have my mother. I cannot, I'm saying I just, I'm scared to, and I can say scared.  
I'm concerned about putting myself at a financial risk in her health, in her care. It will be, be  
involved. Does that make sense? No, no, no, I get it and I hear you.  
I get it and I hear you, okay? I hear you loud and clear, okay? I also know that an increase inworry is a decrease in faith. I know that wholeheartedly. I also know that I'm willing to lose  
100,000 to make a million.  
And this is somebody that also has three kids and a wife to take care of. I'm willing to lose 1  
million to make 10 million. I'm willing to lose 10 million to make 100 million because at the end  
of the day, I also know this.  
I have enough. I've always had enough. I always will have enough.  
There is not a day in the 39 years and 20 something days that I have been born that I have not  
had enough. Not a single one. I may not have had everything I wanted, but there was not a  
single day that I did not have enough.  
You're right. I could attest to that same truth. You're right.  
Might not have had everything that I wanted, but I had everything that I needed, yes. 1,000%.  
And so this is, I wanna present to you five rules, okay? Five rules.  
One rule is reality is not a physical game because right now you're looking at the reality of  
things. Oh, I'm a realist. I'm a realist.  
I'm looking at what it is. I hear you talk the same way that my wife talks. Reality is not a physical  
game.  
Reality is a mental game because nothing manifests in the physical without first manifesting in  
the spiritual. Okay, so you have to seek yourself with your mother getting sick and you not  
making enough money and everything going down the drain before it can actually manifest  
into the physical side of things. That's first and foremost.  
Okay, reality is a mental, spiritual game, all right? And the people that play to win this game of  
life play it on the mental plane. We do not play it on the physical plane. The physical plane is  
just a mirror effect of what we've already been dealing with up here.  
So I've already won every game that I step into up here. I may have setbacks. I may have things  
that come across that were not in the necessarily the plan of it.  
But at the end of the day, I have won it up here. That's why I never fail, I always learn. Because  
at the end of the day, it's always an experience.  
And those experiences that we have here on this physical plane are all meant to teach us  
something, okay? People who are looking for the reasons that things may fail are looking at the  
physical side before looking at the mental. Stop looking at the physical side, okay? The world  
can only show you evidence of what it is that you are thinking consistently. That is the only  
thing that it can show you evidence of, all right? The next rule that I wanna go up to go with  
you, you make the rules.That's rule number two, you make the rules. So in your life, if the rule is I cannot do this  
because my mom might fall into health and I can't allow that to happen and be broke, that's the  
rule that you're gonna live by. You make the rules, okay? So you get a chance every day to write  
down in the mental, and you can do turn around and write in the physical, what rules you want  
to play life by.  
You have that option to write those rules down. Right now, I know where your rules are going.  
Your rules are, if it doesn't make sense on paper, I can't go forward with it.  
Rule number two, if it puts my mom in danger, I can't go forward with it. Rule number three,  
I've played the game before and I'm not in the game right now, and I don't know if I can get  
back in the game. Rule number four, tell me what rule number four is.  
Because I'm just reverberating exactly what you're saying. No, no, no. I guess I don't have any  
rules, I'm just treading.  
No, you do, everybody has rules. I'm just observing right now. I guess, because I have, you  
know, I'm 53\.  
By the time I was 26, I had three rental properties. I bought my first home when I was 21, and  
I'm staying in the home paid off that I bought my first home right now, and it's paid off. But I'm  
just saying, and that's not, I'm just saying, I've been there, I've been on both sides of the fence,  
but what I'm just trying to say, I'm treading now because it's just not me anymore.  
My son has grown, okay, so I'm not worried about him, but I'm just saying, my thing is, it's just  
these, like you say, I guess I have to, to be able to do this and do what you're doing now at your  
age, you have to be in your head. Yeah, you have to get out of the physical. Yeah, you have to.  
But I'm saying, I've been on both sides of this before. You know? So that's what I'm saying, I've  
been on both sides, I've been on both sides of the game before. So right now, okay, right, right  
now, we're going back to the fact that the numbers aren't number net.  
This got me feeling like last year, boy, when we all, boy, we grew up on for newbies after dark  
right now, if y'all ain't know, we've transitioned over. All right, we officially are a group of  
newbies after dark right now. And wait a minute, and time, we all have to admit is money, and  
money is time.  
I don't have to admit that. Time is not money to me. Like Ms. Smith said, she was off, she had  
been laid off, or she was not working at the time when she had people.  
Okay, but I work a full-time job. I mean, like, plus maybe overtime. But, and that's not no  
excuse, because I can do on weekends, I can study that, I'm just like, you know, to be able to  
jump in like 100% and get this done and do it right, I have to have the time to invest in it.  
Time is not money. To me, it is. Time is not money.And that's a rule that you live by. See, y'all got rules. You either pay for somebody else's time, or  
it takes time out of where you could be making money at.  
Okay, can you make time? Can you make time? I can't make time, but I can control what I do  
with the time that I have, yeah. Exactly, now you can control what you do with that time. So  
here's the thing.  
If you can only dedicate, and this is what I've also come to a realization of as well through  
teaching tons and tons of people, I can't make you see what you don't wanna see. No, I'm here  
for a reason, to learn. I'm not trying to downgrade anything that you're saying.  
I'm actually putting five on it. It can be done, but I'm saying, it's just, for me, it's a big, I mean,  
we also, we can't, to me, and this is just personal, I can't be oblivious of the risk of it, because I  
have been on both sides of the fence. This is not new to me.  
I just haven't had people, to me, I'm telling you, it was either this or doing the pad split thing.  
And for me, the pad split thing maybe looks more promising to me because of the fact, a lot of  
factors that you just laid out about people with different incomes now might be having financial  
hardships, their credit might go down, so they can't, a lot of times, even to rent, you have to  
have decent credit now. The housing market in Texas is ridiculous.  
Pad split, and then it's less maintenance. The care, you get somebody in there once a week to  
clean it. Everything is automated.  
They pay their rent online. This is my son, he used to stay with me when I learned about a pad  
split. And it frees up a lot more of my time to where I don't have to be there at first.  
I can show you emails, and I'm talking about not a few, but tons. You know where Pad Split  
used to source their properties for Texas and Florida from? No, where? Me. Oh, really? Yes, I  
can show you tons and tons of emails of where every week my entire team was only sourcing  
deals in Florida, in Tampa, Jacksonville, Houston, and Dallas when they were still getting, I knew  
every market that was getting ready to open up for Pad Split before anybody else knew it  
because we were the ones that were sourcing deals for them on a weekly basis before Pad  
Split.  
That is a great platform right there. But I still have to do it for my mother. I still haven't said,  
take in mind, so I thought this would be perfect for me because it would free up a little bit of  
my time and then I can keep my eyes on her a little bit more because now I'm paying for, me  
and my sister and I were paying for a part-time sitter, just a sitter, not a nurse because she's  
still mobile and everything.  
She just has somebody has to be here with her. But yeah, so it would free up, this would be,  
and that's why I continue to see how this could work for me, try to make this work for me. You  
need a game plan.Mr. Rich, I'm not trying to convince, I'm not trying to say that this can't work. It's just the time  
and the dedication and the money it would take to make it work. You know what I'm saying?  
Am I willing to- Well, here's the thing, it's gonna take some money for Pad Split as well because  
you're gonna have to go in and rehab the property because they're gonna have to, here's what  
Pad Split needs to do.  
Pad Split needs each house, depending upon where the house is, to be at least a 10, I mean,  
each room to be a 10 by seven, okay? What they're gonna do is they're going to come in. And  
how do I know this? Because I used to go out and do the measurements for some rooms so  
that I could then send the renderings back to them to make sure that they could get, that they  
would be able to turn the house over. And the only reason I did that was because they were  
running out of surveyors to be able to go to these houses.  
And we were sending them so many properties that we needed to turn it over faster so that we  
could sell it to them and make money in my company. I know it in and out. Yeah.  
Like people don't really know how much and how deep that I have been in the real estate world  
and in the real estate business, but I'm letting you know it's deep. And it's with companies and  
hedge funds and other things that people had no clue about that my company was the one that  
was making moves with them in the background. Yeah.  
And so when it comes to the stuff with Pad Split, you have to realize that when you are going in  
to do a Pad Split property, it may not operate or may not work for them. So you still gonna have  
to worry like if that's going to work for them, but a group home is going to work regardless  
because you are the one that are making the rules and making the splits and how everything  
goes just as long as you're following the city ordinances of how that portion of it goes. Now,  
from a time perspective, because this is one of the things that's important to you because of  
your mother that you are having to take care of and you're having to do different things with,  
you may not be able to start fully right now from just running a house all out.  
You may start how we were talking about earlier with going in the fact of, you know what? I  
can't necessarily, I don't have eight hours to go dedicate to this, but I got two hours to make  
phone calls to the nurses that are on the night shift to see exactly who they have. And while I'm  
sitting here and I'm taking care of my mother, I can also be making these calls so that I can be  
confident enough to whenever it is time for me to open my house that I can still make those  
same calls. And that's truly why I'm here to see and listen and to see how this could work for  
me.  
Not saying that it can't be done. I'm just saying, how could this work for me personally? That's  
why I'm here. I'm not, that's why I just don't want you to get confused.  
I'm not- No, no, no. I'm just, I'm messing around with you right now a little bit. Yeah, no, I'm not  
trying to say it doesn't work.I'm just saying that's why I'm here and that's why I joined the Facebook group and that's why I  
tried to. But another thing Ms. Ned did that I was confused about and I couldn't catch up  
because a lot of people had a lot of comments that were going a lot of different ways on the  
Facebook group. I think at one time she said the platform had changed.  
And so we weren't getting a lot of the information. I think she changed it to another Facebook  
group. Maybe.  
No, no, no. You got to get on school because the algorithms inside of the Facebook group  
started tripping a little bit. Zuckerberg started tightening the clamps on things that everybody  
can see.  
You see, when too much good information started getting out and Zuckerberg don't have his  
hands in it, sometimes you want to just cut us off a little bit and not let everybody see it. That's  
what I'm chalking it up to anyway. But that if you go over to school, which she's posted several,  
several times inside the group tonight, get on the school platform so that you can make sure  
that you get all the announcements and get all the information and know all the conference  
people are there.  
Yeah, because I didn't even know there was a conference coming up in Dallas. I might, you  
know, I just learned about that tonight. And I'm on the Facebook group.  
And guess what? We're going to have a ball. You know what I'm talking about in Dallas?  
Because I'm going to be running around the room. You thinking about it.  
Okay, go ahead. Look at what you, you have a tennis ball. We're going to have a basketball.  
You know what I'm saying? We're going to have ourselves a good time. That's all I'm saying. I  
can imagine.  
I can just imagine. That's all I'm saying, man. I'm going to be the Williams brothers and live and  
live in color.  
All right, in Dallas. And I just want to say, I just want to thank you all because I have been  
following for about a year now. And I think it's remarkable, you know, just the platform itself on  
just the information that's provided because I would do the same.  
Once I would strategize and learn different things, like just because of myself being a real  
estate over the years. Now, my sister, she is, she's an investor. She has rental properties all over  
Houston.  
And she also, she just broke ground on the duplex that she's building from the ground up. So  
I'm very proud of her, but I do share knowledge. You know, it's just that, you know, I feel like  
that's important.  
And that is one of the main reasons why I said, you know what? I'm going to get into this group.I'm going to see what it's all about because, you know, Ms. Nett, and I'm not too, I haven't seen  
you too much on Facebook, but on her page, she gives a lot of knowledge, you know, for free,  
that a lot of people charge for. And we just appreciate her with even handling the people that  
are starting from scratch.  
I mean, they have really jumped off the porch and she's there to help. And God, that is  
remarkable. And I just want to give her her flowers right now.  
If I never talked to her, neither, you know, that's all going to come back. I'm sure you already  
know, the Lord is already blessing you and what have you. I'm sure.  
You too. Yeah, of course. I'm giving her her flowers because I might not be there in Dallas, but  
I'm going to be online watching her.  
I'm going to be her cheerleader. Man, it is. I will tell you this, Angie, you know, it will not happen  
until you see it.  
Okay? It will not happen until you see it. And you will not see it until you believe it. And you will  
not believe it until you desire it enough.  
You're right. Okay, that right there, that is the cycle of it, okay? First it starts off as a desire. That  
desire then becomes a belief, you know, or that desire then becomes a thought.  
That thought then becomes a belief. That belief becomes a feeling. That feeling becomes an  
emotion.  
Emotion is just energy in motion. That emotion then becomes action. That action then becomes  
a result.  
That result returns back to more thoughts and more desires and more beliefs. And it's just a  
cycle that goes on and on and on and on. So you have to have the desire to have this business  
more so than you have the desire to figure out why the numbers aren't working.  
Well, I think more so, the thing about it is I just got to get my wind back. Because- There we go,  
okay. Just get my wind back, pretty much.  
You know, because they used to call me the rabbit in the office. Cause baby, you just, you show  
me one time and I'm gonna go get it. I was- So what happened, rabbit? I just, you know, just  
time and things and circumstances and a whole lot of things happened in my life.  
It just, you know, you just have to, and that's probably why I'm still on the Facebook page. You  
know, I want the wind. Maybe I want to get it back or I wanna do, you know, dibble and dabble  
a little bit more.  
But you know, I don't know yet. And maybe that's what it is. You know what I'm saying? I just-  
Well, I know I could do it.I know that. I know I could do it. You know, like you said, how, you know, you know, I just have  
to get there.  
I just have to jump off the porch. It's like, I got a toe off the porch, right? I haven't made that  
jump. I just got the toe.  
I got one toe off. I'm gonna tell you, Angie, okay? When you have just one toe off the porch,  
you're still very stable on why you don't, can't do it. Yeah, I know.  
Okay? You're very, very, you have a good foundation still sitting there on why you can't do it.  
And right now, you know, I love when people say, oh, you know, life is life. And no, I don't know.  
Because I don't look at life like that. I look at everything as an experience that's teaching me  
something. And all of these experiences that's teaching me something are for my good.  
Yeah. Are for, every last one of them are for my good. And every last one of them for you are  
for your good.  
All things work for the good of those who love the Lord. You're right about that. I know.  
I don't need no clarification or no co-signing. I know. I'm telling you because I need to make  
sure that you know.  
Yeah. And like, look, man, this, whatever it is that you are going through, you have to recognize  
that it is not a stop sign. You are going through it.  
That's right. Like, you acting like these situations are a stop sign. You acting like you're the only  
person in your world and in everything that you're living in that is going through it.  
You're not. Yeah. So we need to dust this stuff off our shoulders that our problems make us  
special because they don't.  
Everybody is going through the same thing in a different, that's everybody else in different  
levels of intensity. So our problems don't make us special. How we handle them and how we  
think about them does.  
Because you're either gonna allow it to deplete you of energy, which is going to put you in  
depression. Because that's all depression is. Depression is just a depletion of energy.  
Yeah. When that energy, when the energy that you have that's inside of you just deplete, goes  
all the way out, you have nothing left to go through than hopelessness and depression. Okay.  
But if you understand that the energy what it is that you are going through is just simply  
something that you are going through. And it is an experience that is put there to help you to  
learn because you already know that whatever you're going to get from that experience is only  
there to help you with the next experience that you're about to go through. You understandthat it is for your good.  
Why God did you choose me in order to have to take care of my mother? What is that  
experience helping me out? Oh, could it be? Because I'm gonna have to take care of a whole  
bunch of other people coming up pretty soon and show them the world. And they may not  
necessarily be my mother but they're all gonna be going through things and I'm gonna have to  
treat them like I'm their daughter. No doubt.  
Is it the simple fact that right now I'm going through this mindset shift where I only believe the  
things that I see and not necessarily the things that are in my head right now so the things that  
I'm seeing are not yet what I want them to be because I'm doing it backwards and I'm not  
believing first and then seeing. I'm not walking by faith. I'm walking by sight.  
And sometimes when the sight ain't exactly what I want it to be, I put on these bifocals. Not  
realizing that all I have to do is change my beliefs to change what exactly what it is that I see.  
But that may be the lesson that I'm going through right here and why I'm going through this  
and why things aren't going necessarily the way I want them to go because I need to change  
the way that I am, the order in which I'm doing things.  
I'm trying to see then believe instead of believing and then see. Well, I'm definitely trying to  
figure it out. That's why I'm here tonight listening.  
And so with that, you got to understand that the words that you spewed to me a little bit  
earlier, I rejected every last one of them because that's not the way that my mind operates and  
that's not the things that I believe in because you went on an entire tirade of why you could not  
do this and then you backed it up and say, oh, but I can do it. You're a walking contradiction  
right now and you need to fix that. But I'm not, but no, no, no.  
I wasn't trying to say, that's not true. No, no, no, no, that's not true. Every truth is only a half-  
truth because when I show you evidence of it, I see it.  
In my heart of hearts, when I put my mind to something, I really can do anything I choose to  
do. All of us can, it's the only way we can. Yeah, I could do it, yeah, but I'm saying, like you say,  
but at what cost? That's what I'm saying, what's the cost? That's what I'm saying, at what cost?  
That's my end game, what is the cost of it? Not just monetarily, I'm not just monetarily,  
physically, spiritually, mental, it's a lot that goes with all of that, you know what I mean? There  
is, and here's the thing, you've been equipped with everything that you need to pay the cost.  
You've been equipped with everything that you need. If you believe that it's exactly what you  
wanna do and you believe it with conviction that it is already done and you just have to step  
into it, well then at that point you have been equipped with everything that you need to pay  
whatever the cost is going to be. See, we start getting to worry when we don't necessarily see  
what the next dollar is or the next this or the next that is, we start to worry and we forget that  
God took care of the birds in the sky and the flowers of the ground and act like he won't takecare of us 10 times more.  
You gonna make me go real biblical on you, like I curse and have fun and all this other stuff, but  
the people that know, they know. I can switch it up real quick and pull out every verse that you  
need me to pull out. I know you can, so I'm kidding anyway.  
And help you understand that you got it in you already. Everybody, that's all 116 people that are  
still on here right now at this exact moment, you are not looking for anything else outside of  
you to go out and do what it is that you need to do right now. Everything that you need is  
already within you, you just have to believe it.  
I get so upset and I'm not even like, I'm a person that I love to laugh, I love to smile, but when I  
hear certain things from people as to why they can't do something, it upsets me because I have  
unlocked the secrets of this world. I understand the fact that it is all up here. Anything that we  
need to do, that we wanna do, that we have to do, that we must do, that we aspire to do, it has  
to be done up here first before it can be done out there.  
And if there's any contradiction up here to what it is that you're trying to do out there, out there  
is going to lose. And whatever you're thinking about up here is gonna be the thing that went  
good, bad or indifferent. Tap into your power, like real talk.  
Tap into the power that is within you to do all things, to do all things, everything. I gotta go  
back and I gotta read this because I broke it down for one of my boys the other day that was  
going through some stuff and he didn't realize that he was going through it and I just had to  
help him understand. That he is going through it, it's not happening to him even though he  
thought it was happening to him but it's not, let me get back to this.  
Okay, so what I said to him, I said, I learned, and this was when I was talking to him about a  
time that I was going through it in life. I said, I learned everything I could about the  
subconscious mind during that time, literally everything. I needed to learn how to transmute  
the feelings I was having to work for me instead of against me.  
It's a huge part of how I transformed into the Attitude Alchemist. I learned that the universe  
can only show us evidence of what we are consistently thinking and feeling. That reality as we  
see it isn't real, it's just evidence of what we've been thinking.  
Then I had to go biblical to understand the power that I possessed and how to use it. The first  
thing that God told us in Genesis 1.1 was that he is a creator, thus in the beginning God  
created. Then in Genesis 1.26, he told us that we are creators by saying, let us make man in our  
own image and likeness.  
This let me know that I had the power of God in me to create whatever I wanted. Then in Isaiah  
45.7, I learned that with that power, we create everything and no one else creates anything for  
us, thus that's the reason that God said in that verse, I form the light and create darkness, I  
make peace and create the evil, I the Lord do all these things. Then I had to reference Matthew6.33 to learn that what I should be going after, seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these  
other things will be added to you.  
I took that to mean that the good that I wanted to create in my life, I had to go and seek out the  
kingdom first and then all the good will come to me. Then I went to Luke 17.21 and it told me  
that the kingdom of heaven was within me, so I knew I had to go within and find me through  
my storms. Then I had to go to Romans 12.2 and it told me to be not conformed to this world,  
but be transformed by the renewing of my mind.  
And that was a master key because everything else before then was leading me to understand  
that I had to change my mind on how I looked at things in order to create the life that I wanted  
through everything that I was going through. And finally, when I understood that, I had to go  
back to Isaiah 45.17 to realize that no weapons formed against me shall prosper. They may  
form, but they won't prosper.  
And with that, I began mentally, I became mentally unfuckwithable. I didn't mean to curse right  
there with God and through this, you will too. It's all in there.  
Food for thought, definitely. Thank you. It's all in there.  
All right, you figure out how you want to use it, but it's all in there. Preach, God, preach. Amen.  
Angie, you came in here to get somebody to convince you of how it could work. That's not our  
job. That's not Lynette's job.  
That's not my job. That's not Will's job. That's not Johnny's job.  
No, it's nobody's job in here to convince you as to if it can work and how it can work. It's our job  
to let you know that it works. And it's up to you and how you think about it and the actions that  
you take and the time that you're going to put into it.  
Even if you have to put 20 minutes a day, that 20 minutes a day translates over to an hour and a  
half or two hours a week. That gives you a hundred and something hours that you can put into  
it in a year that you wouldn't have put into it otherwise. That gets you a little bit further ahead.  
And before you know it, it's just going to do like interesting compound for you. It's not our job  
to convince you that it works. It's our job to let you know the different ways that it works and  
your job to figure out which way you want to use.  
Fair enough? Fair enough. Thank you. No problem.  
Lynette, back to you, my sister. I'm here just listening. So yeah, I hope y'all enjoy tonight.  
Now we do have a guest speaker that will be coming on tomorrow. I'll post that link in the  
group in the morning. She'll be talking about home care.Like I was telling y'all that we want to start talking more about home care because we have to  
get these wraparound services in place in order to, you know, get as much of the pie as  
possible, eat much as the pie as possible. Make sure you all are following my personal page so  
that you don't miss updates. So if you in school, you're on my personal page and in the group,  
you know, it'll be the likeliness of you missing updates will be slim to none because I do cross  
posts on all three pages.  
And so, yeah, I hope that we was able to give you all some value tonight and some, you know,  
things that you can use to take some action tomorrow. Please give feedback in the group  
tonight or tomorrow to let other people know about these Q\&A meetings. Of course, Facebook  
algorithm suppresses content and not everybody gets notified.  
And so we want to be able to impact as much, as many people as possible. So again, I  
appreciate you all for coming on. It's been a pleasure for me as always to be able to provide  
information to the people in the community.  
And yeah, just keep showing up. And so y'all have a good night. Dawn, please come to  
Cleveland.  
Good night. Good night, everyone. Good night.  
Buena noche.
