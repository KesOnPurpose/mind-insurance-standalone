Goup home Newbies training 7:22:25  
I would recognize and understand that it is capable. So without further ado, my sister, the  
person that you will see me go 10 toes down and 10 fingers down for at all times, Lynette  
Wheaton. What's up sis? Hey, it's been a long day, but we here.  
We are here and so we're gonna have a good time tonight. I will get ready to share with you all  
my PowerPoint presentation. I ask that you hold your questions to the end.  
Also, we will be doing a Q\&A at the end. So just hang tight and stay with us throughout the  
duration of the meeting. I am excited for you all.  
And we're gonna go ahead and jump right on in. All right, so before we get started, I wanna  
make sure that you have yourself a notebook to take notes because we'll be dropping gems  
throughout the meeting. And I don't want anyone to miss out on any valuable information  
because a lot of things that we may discuss may not make a lot of sense to you as a new  
person, but you'll be able to refer back to it once you reach, you know, get to that situation.  
So definitely when you are on a Zoom call, make sure you are taking notes. Second thing is  
making sure that you're not pitching any products or services inside the Zoom meetings or  
inside of the Facebook Group Homes for Newbies community or our school group. If you have  
any type of products or services that you would like for the members to hear about, contact  
one of the admins or moderators inside of Group Homes for Newbies so that you can go  
through the vetting process.  
This is just designed to keep down people from pitching services and potentially putting our  
members at risk of being scammed. So we do have a vetting process. And also make sure that  
you're not pitching in people's DM without their permission.  
Most time when people are asking questions instead of commenting, saying, oh, DM me, just  
take the same time you was gonna DM back and forth and put the substance of the answer  
inside of the comment section so that when other peoples may have the same or similar  
question, they can go back and read that answer. So please do not message our members  
without permission, pitching services or DMing people and they complain on you. We'll get you  
banned from our community.  
All right, so let's see the first time visitors. If this is your first time joining a Group Homes for  
Newbies Zoom call, put a one in the chat. All right, we got a lot of new people.  
I welcome you all. You will find this information very helpful as well as being a part of Group  
Homes for Newbies. We created an atmosphere for everyone to be able to lean on each other,  
support one another and just become a tribe.  
So you definitely have found your people. Stick with it. If this is your first time getting into theentrepreneur space, it is not easy, but it is simple, especially when you have your support group  
and being able to build your network.  
But we won't leave you astray. Just continue to show up for yourself. Continue to move the  
needle in your business.  
And you'll be fine. And let's see one more time where everyone is from. Well, you may see  
somebody in the chat that's near you.  
So let's see where everybody's from. Okay, we got people from all across the country. And so  
what I want you all to look at is, when I get ready and share this information with you all,  
understand that this information can be duplicated in any city or any state.  
There may be a few one-offs here and there, but it's nothing that myself personally cannot help  
you navigate, regardless of what area you in. My model has been tried and tested. And  
regardless of where you live with this unlicensed model, you can do it.  
All right, and so here I have some community news. So basically, Dion Lewis, the one who  
introduced himself earlier, he is seeking door knockers in Atlanta and the Houston Metro area.  
Basically, we're wholesaling real estate.  
He's looking for people in the community to go up to the houses to help make a connection. He  
will pay you commission-based. If you are interested in learning anything about wholesaling,  
this is kind of like a good position to be in because you will be in the field working while making  
money and while learning.  
So if this is something that you're interested in, if you're in a Houston or Atlanta Metro area,  
you can screenshot this slide and email Dion in regards to that. If you are seeking to open up a  
licensed youth group home, regardless of what state you're in, Mr. William Chapman III has a  
private community for those of you who are interested in opening a licensed youth group  
home. It's gonna be a community strictly for the licensed youth homes so that you're not  
overwhelmed with other things inside of group homes for newbies.  
So if a youth group home is something that you're looking at doing, his email is at the bottom  
as well. Let me know if y'all see my PowerPoint. Yes, we can see it.  
All right, so those that don't see it, you have to check your settings. All right, so screenshot that  
and Will will be able to give you the information you need to be able to connect with him for the  
youth home. And lastly, McHale Mitchell does local meetups for group homes for newbies.  
So if you're interested in him coming to your area for a local meetup so you can meet other  
people in your state, that's the email to make contact with him. Also, make sure if you are  
looking to be at a local meetup that you're in the area where there's more people that would  
like to do it as well. So he's not going to travel to do a local meetup for just one person that  
wanna do a meetup.Make sure that you're in an area where there's multiple people who are interested. And that's  
his email there at the bottom. All right, so with today's agenda, I'm going to go over my story  
and how I got started.  
Go over a few frequently asked questions and then talk to you a little bit about the net effect  
powered by the bread room strategy, my proven method to keep beds full and referrals  
flooring. Also remember, after this presentation, I will do a live Q\&A, so do not leave. All right,  
so what if I told you that spare rooms or vacant houses near you can replace your nine to five?  
And you can get this done without a license, without owning a property or begging for clients.  
Some of you may already transition out of a nine to five, but many of you are still working  
there. And with this business model, with the amount of people who are needing safe, clean  
and affordable housing options, you'll be able to provide that space for those individuals who  
are on fixed income, who can pay their rent every single month due to them having guaranteed  
income. All right, so how I got started.  
I was a correctional officer watching people get released with nowhere to go. Back in 2021, I  
got started with my very first group home business, right? I did have a four bedroom house. My  
kids was gone to Mississippi for that summer.  
And I was able to utilize the three empty rooms to get started with housing people who are  
returning home from prison, as well as people who were in a community. When I got started,  
the reason why I got started was because as working as a correctional officer, I saw the need  
that was happening across the different penitentiaries I was working at. So what I found was  
that most people who was making parole or discharging their sentence did not have an  
address to parole to, especially those who were, let's just say, making parole.  
Because those individuals, they have to make sure that they have an address to parole to. And  
those are the set of people that was incarcerated that actually pulled on my heartstrings to  
know that there are men and women who are incarcerated, who has already went up for  
parole, received their parole certificate, and could not be released from prison due to not  
having an address. I had to watch this for years.  
And I just, you know, something inside of me was like, you know, it wasn't right. Because if they  
could make the necessary, you know, meet the qualifications to make parole, to be free, I just  
felt like, you know, the guys and the ladies should be able to get out and, you know, start  
moving forward with their reintegration back into society. And so that's how I got started,  
seeing that there was a huge need for people who are returning home from prison, and I  
wanted to do something about it.  
And while making sure that I solved the problem for those individuals, I was fortunately enough  
to grow my business to a half a million dollars a year at max capacity. I have now went from  
three beds in my personal home, or three bedrooms, housing six people in my personal home,  
to now scaling my business to 48 beds, bringing me in a half a million dollars a year. And I dohouse 80% of my people are returning citizens, and about 20% comes from the community.  
I have a good mixed balance of individuals who are coming back into the community, or  
already in the community, but my why was getting started for the individuals who was  
incarcerated. But while going through my journey, I learned that not only people who was  
incarcerated needed safe, clean, and affordable housing options, and had guaranteed income,  
there were people in the community that needed the same thing as well. So I just basically cast  
a wide net between the community and the Department of Corrections to make sure that I  
keep my beds filled.  
I could essentially only do people in the community, but I prefer to house people who are  
coming home from prison because it's just a different level of gratitude and appreciation. I  
found that people who are returning home from prison is the residents that stay with me the  
longest. Most of those individuals are seniors who grew up in the penitentiary without family  
support, their loved ones passed and gone, or there could be issues where people had broken  
bones while they were incarcerated.  
So they don't have a lot of resources when they are returning home from prison as those who  
are in the community. So that's just my reason for housing those individuals primarily. All right,  
so, and here's what shocked me when I got started.  
So at the time I was charging $650 a month per bed, and I had two beds per room. So  
altogether I had six beds at $650 a month, and I was bringing in $3,900 for those three  
bedrooms. And my mortgage at the time was only $1,200.  
So I was covering my entire mortgage and I was averaging about another $500 of overhead  
expenses. So that was leaving me $2,200 after expenses. Plus I had my own bedroom, of  
course, and my common areas in my house was dedicated for my use.  
So it wasn't uncomfortable for me to get started. And that's kind of like the base rent at the  
time. I allowed them to stay in my personal home June and July of 2021\.  
I was able to get my very first rental August of 2021\. And here it is four years later that I am still,  
I still have my very first house and I was being able to scale by using a rental arbitrage method.  
I don't encourage people to scale their business using the rental arbitrage method simply  
because the best side to be on is ownership.  
I've learned different ways to be able to gain properties using other people's money or  
different creative ways to be able to obtain properties. That was something that I learned here  
recently from Don and Mikhail and Dion. And so now I realized that I made a mistake.  
Although I am still cash flowing well and I am profiting with my business, I'm paying out about  
$100,000 a year. $100,000, no, not a year. Since opening my first group home, so let's just say  
for instance, my very first one, from the time I signed the lease up until now, I've paid my  
landlord a little over $110,000 for his property.And the property is only valued at around $230,000. So I pretty much done help pay his  
mortgage off, right? So he's building equity and he has an appreciating asset while I am just  
cash flowing out of his property. If I would have known what I've known now, I would have  
utilized the rental arbitrage method to get started and start saving up my money to find some  
sub two deals or some seller financing deals, but definitely not going four years renting out  
multiple homes.  
So when I teach, I like to teach from my experience and as well as mistakes that I've made so  
that you all do not have to continue down the journey that I went down. So if you're interested  
in any type of real estate classes or anything like that, definitely reach out to Dion so that he  
can break down creative real estate so that you can understand how to be able to get these  
properties. Because at the time when I got started, I only knew of the traditional way of getting  
a house.  
And so at the time, that wasn't something that I was able to do. So I thought due to me  
knowing about creative financing now. So definitely reach out to Dion Lewis for more  
information about creative real estate.  
And so when I got started, I did not have a medical background. I did not have a real estate  
license. I didn't have a course, a portfolio of rental properties.  
I just had a problem, my own house and a mission. And I figured out now how I've been able to  
accept people into my homes and be able to do some life transformation for those individuals.  
And with my blueprint now, I've been able to help thousands of other people across the country  
do the same.  
And so why does this matter now? So understand that there are thousands of people, hundreds  
of thousands of people across the country who are on low income. Understand that there are  
halfway houses in every state, but they are full. Just because people make parole and they  
should be released.  
If the halfway houses are full, they don't go out building more halfway houses to be able to  
allow people to return home. They just have to get on the waiting list. And some of those  
waiting lists is over a year long.  
And then of course you have the people that's within the community that are desperate to help  
you fill your beds. The people in the community, these are people who deal with our population  
in some type of institutional setting. And once they reach their level of discharge and they don't  
have a place to go, they look for group home operators to be able to assist them with discharge  
placements.  
And so after years of being into this space, I realized that I was transforming lives one bed at a  
time. Hey, Mr. Gaines. Hello.  
I just want you to just tell your story. Like how we met? Yeah. I met you down on where a pianobred Wells Fargo's bank.  
Mm-hmm. And you asked me how I was doing and I told you that I was homeless and that's  
how we met. Yeah.  
What did you pray for? I prayed that I would find housing and here I am, I found it. Or did it find  
you? I think it found me more than that. For sure.  
Okay. And also, did you know that boarding homes existed? Yes and no. Because back from  
where I'm from, the boarding homes are set up differently.  
They're like, a lot of them have like rep payees where they get your checks and stuff like that. I  
don't think you do that. No, I only become the rep payee if people are incoherent and they  
aren't able to process what funds are.  
So basically, a severe intellectual disability or a mental illness or some type of memory issues.  
Okay, cool. Yeah, so I don't be a payee unless, and you don't qualify for that, so no.  
Right. But you seem like a sweet heart lady. And no, I'm not hitting on you.  
All right, so with this guy, he was somebody that I got from the community. I have a good eye  
for people who have guaranteed income. I could just, I don't know, I'm just good at it.  
It's just a gift. So when I'm out in the community, and let's just say for instance, one of my  
sweet spots is knowing that people who are on social security benefits, if they get a direct  
express car, it was pretty much a Comerica bank account. Most times on the first and the third,  
you will see a lot of people who are homeless around banks trying to withdraw their money.  
They're just outside more. Back when I was doing a lot of boots on the ground marketing, the  
first and the third was like my days to be outside because the people who have guaranteed  
income was outside too, especially those who are near like different homeless shelters and  
other non-profit organizations that cater to the homeless population. You will just see that it's  
just a flock of them.  
And then even still there was like, we have like different non-profit organizations that do  
feeding. And like on Sundays, it's a non-profit organizations here in Houston that does like  
biscuits and gravies on certain Sundays. And so everybody's turning out for biscuits and gravies  
and all you gotta do is just go out there and pass out your information.  
Anybody that appears to be over the age of 65 years old and they're homeless, I typically go up  
to them and have a conversation with them. Anybody who is carrying like large items, like big  
book bags and suitcases and things like that. And they're not in an area where most of the  
homeless camps are.  
I have conversations with them as well. I really don't go into different homeless camps because  
most of them are people who are not looking to be placed. I try to find ones that homelessnessis new to them.  
That way I can get them to convert into my homes quicker because if somebody who is  
chronically homeless and they've been homeless for years and they're used to it, it's their new  
normal, it's sometimes hard to convert those individuals. Especially if they are experiencing  
severe mental health challenges and substance abuse as well. But I do wanna make sure that I  
do notate that not everybody who is homeless is income-less.  
So understand that there's money out there in the homeless population. You just have to make  
sure that you know how to properly assess them and get them into your community. And one  
thing I do do, if I get someone off the street, I do have to make sure that they are open to going  
into getting a medical clearance from the hospital to just make sure that they are in compliance  
with their medications and things like that.  
I really don't like to get someone directly off the street if they show signs of having any type of  
mental health challenges or medical conditions because most times when I do get people from  
the community, I'm getting them from some sort of hospital facility. So I created a three-part  
system, not just for me, but for others to follow as well. It is called The Net Effect, powered by  
The Bread Room Strategy.  
Learn how I turn spare rooms into consistent cashflow and you can too. And for those that  
follow me will know that The Net Effect is basically me showing where I get an average of 15  
leads per week through various channels. And I usually post it on my story so that people can  
see that people are in need.  
I've been doing this for four years now and my phone is still continuously ringing off the hook. I  
have to refer out my different leads to different mentees that I have that's local to me simply  
because my beds usually stay at max capacity simply because I never stop marketing. And so  
the three-step parts of The Bread Room Strategy is lead channels that hit.  
So basically showing you how to connect with different referral sources that most people  
overlook, homes that convert. So you'll be able to see how my rooms are set up and being able  
to pitch a landlord. And then making your business operational.  
So you'll be able to set up the entire business, have all of your onboarding documents and just  
have your back office set up and things like that because I do want you to understand that,  
yeah, it sounds simple enough to get a house, put some beds in it and start trying to get leads  
in it but that's not how you actually run a business. When running a business, you have to make  
sure you have systems in place, policies and procedures, SOPs, making sure you have a  
merchant account, making sure that you have your day-to-day operations within your home  
together, making sure that everything in your back office is in sync, making sure that you have  
your marketing strategies down, how often you're gonna market your business, how you're  
gonna follow up, how you're gonna convert leads, how you're gonna bring them all the way to  
the door. It's more things with owning a business than just putting somebody in the housebecause when you run your business sloppy, if you're a sloppy business owner, it's gonna  
reflect in your bank account.  
So I created this bread room strategy so that I can help people get past the hurdles that I had  
to get past in order to scale my business. So number one, lead channels that hit, referral  
sources that most people overlook. So these are some of just some freebies right here.  
You can look into different county social services departments, nonprofit housing  
organizations, veteran assistant programs, reentry organizations for formerly incarcerated  
individuals, mental health and substance abuse treatment centers, and different social workers,  
discharges and case managers. These people are going to be the ones that, a few of them,  
because I go on a deep dive, I can deep dive each component, but these are the people that  
you wanna make connections with. And so like with the leads that hit, these are just some of  
the screenshots that I've put in just to be able to show you that when you market your  
business, it doesn't matter in which direction.  
There are so many people in the community who need support. There's people who are  
returning home from prison that need support as well. And understand this one thing, when it  
comes to people who are returning home from prison, those who are returning home from  
prison already have an ex on their back.  
We all have that background system that most traditional places run, right? And it's just pretty  
much an eliminator. And so you just look at in your area, how many thousands of people have a  
background, whether they went to federal prison, state prison, state jail, county jail, certain  
crimes prevent people from allowing them to utilize their property. Not only crimes, but credit  
checks as well.  
So it's so many things that most traditional landlords and different property managers look at  
to be able to qualify you for the home. And the biggest one is making sure you have three times  
the rent. And so people who are on a fixed income, let's just say for instance, somebody who on  
a fixed income, paying income is $3,000 a month.  
In order to be able to go live in a traditional setting, they wanna be able to see that they are  
making three times. So that's $9,000 a month, right? Or three times the rent. Right, and so if the  
rent is, let's just say $1,500, that's $4,500, that person doesn't make three times their rent.  
So there's so many different barriers and challenges that people who, let's just say are on fixed  
income, they have to face, right? And so with my business model, I created a model for people  
who are on fixed income simply because I don't need them to make three times the rent to rent  
out a shared room. Most of my people, I leave them with, I leave them with a certain amount of  
money out of their check each month for my shared and or private rooms. And what that fee is,  
if you look on your state, for your state, it's called a personal needs allowance.  
As long as you are able to leave them with the personal needs allowance, that's all they have tohave of their income. And those are state laws and federal laws as well. So that's a freebie for  
you to be able to help you understand how to price your bed and what you have to leave  
somebody with after their income.  
And so, like I was saying, those traditional qualifiers don't apply to me because I prefer to have  
people who come into the home and can pay their rent on the same time every month without  
delay of hours getting cut, getting laid off and other challenges that people who are in the  
workforce are subjected to. And for me, I just like guaranteed income. On first, third, second  
Saturday, fourth Wednesday, it doesn't matter.  
I like people who have guaranteed income. And so these are just more of some screenshots  
that I had to show for different leads. All right, and so the results of that, I have referrals that  
comes from various resources, whether they call me, text me, send the emails, send letters in  
the mail, because people who are trying to make parole have my business address and they  
write me.  
I get community partners faxing over leads and my website leads. So the bread room strategies  
is how you get your phone ringing off the hook. All right, so number two, homes that convert,  
my room setup game plan and the landlord pitch.  
So you wanna make sure that you have proper furniture that's both comfortable and durable,  
storage solutions that give residents dignity and privacy, safety equipment that meets all local  
requirements, common area arrangements that foster community while preventing conflict,  
maintenance systems that keep properties in excellent condition. So I have developed what I  
call the plug and play system. So you'll be able to create a cozy home on a budget.  
So I spend less than $2,500 furnishing an entire home. Here are some pictures of some of my  
properties. The one on the very, on the right, that was my second property that I got.  
I was able to get three properties my first year of getting started. And honestly, of course, my  
very first resident came in June of 2021\. And so by December of 2021, I had three properties  
already.  
And I can show my leases and you'll be able to see the date. One thing you know about me that  
I'm full of receipts and I have social proof on anything that I talk about. These other pictures on  
the side are two other properties.  
And all of the things that I got were used furniture from areas in my community where more of  
the upper class area people were selling stuff on Facebook market. So when I go out and look  
for used furniture, I definitely go into the areas that are more nicer where people take care of  
things and people that's not really just prone to having bedbugs, smoking in the house and,  
you know, just not furniture that's not in good condition. So everything that you see here is all  
either donated or I purchased at a extremely low rate.  
All right, and so number three, you wanna make sure your business is operational, right?Setting up the business and having all of your own boarding documents, systems in place and  
so forth and so on. This is one of my general flyers that I may shoot to somebody that, you  
know, is inquiring about my housing. But most times when I am marketing my business, I tailor  
my marketing material to whoever it is that I'm talking to.  
So if I'm talking to the VA, I got a flyer that I know what the VA pain points are for the patients  
that they have coming home. I know what they need. So I tailor everything towards their needs.  
If it's a mental health hospital, if it's a LGBT community, if it's a nursing home, prison, whatever,  
I have my general marketing flyer that I can shoot to anybody, like a one size fit all kind of thing  
cause it don't go in depth to anything. But I also have, like I said, various other flyers when I'm  
trying to speak their language. And so as you can see on this particular flyer, there's also  
pictures of me, of my beds staged.  
And again, everything is used. So you don't have to spend a lot of money to make things look  
nice. Like that third picture down where you see those two beds with the two lamps on the  
dresser and those things hanging on the wall.  
I got this stuff for family dollars for $3, their little picture set. So, and you just do things on a  
budget and just bring life to the home. And one of the main things that I want to point out for  
those of you that may be interested in the low income population or people who are a little bit  
more, have a little bit more money, you definitely have to stage your home based on a target or  
the demographic that you're looking to serve.  
So my homes are actually in the economical friendly areas of Houston, AKA the hood. So I don't  
spend a lot of money trying to spruce things up because I did that at first. Let's just say the one,  
two, three, let me see.  
The fourth picture down where you see the beds where there's three beds right there and I  
have all of those decorative pillows on there. It's another bed in that room too. It's just not  
captured in this picture.  
But I spent a lot of money. That was my very first home. The people that I transitioned out of  
my personal home into my very first group home, I spent a lot of money trying to overdo it.  
That's when I learned my lesson. So when I first got started, I did go out and trying to buy  
certain things. But as you can see on that second picture with that private room with those two  
white nightstands in it, by the time I'm hit probably month three or four, the house, they done  
all switched up different nightstands because they didn't want the different nightstands.  
My decorative pillows wasn't decorative pillows anymore. They was sleeping on them like  
regular pillows. Those two beds at the very top.  
So basically the first picture, the second picture and the third picture, they're all in one house.  
And actually that's Harold's house. If y'all know Harold.But when I first got started, I was trying to match up bedding sets and just doing the most. And  
it just wasn't a good idea. Doing stuff like this is for more so of the middle class or upper class  
areas if you're gonna be in there.  
If you are housing people that ain't used to certain things and not living a certain way, you have  
to just do what you need to do to make it a clean and nice space for them and don't go over  
budget. Because I did that the very first time. And so I like to teach from experience.  
So I'm telling you now, if you're dealing with people who are only on SSI, get everything you  
possibly can from different Goodwills and free donations and things like that. Don't go out and  
spend a lot of money because they just don't take care of it. You need systems in place.  
From setting up your business structure, creating your digital footprint, getting leads to the  
door and managing your residents inside the home. I've created every document needed to  
pitch to landlords, scripts for referral partners to cold call and email as well. So the net effect  
powered by the bread room strategy, when you combine the three components that we went  
over, which is the lead channels that hit homes that convert and managing your business, you  
will be able to get different leads and keeping your beds filled.  
So if you can see yourself benefiting from my bread room framework, put a yes in a chat. Put a  
yes in a chat if you feel like this is something that you can benefit from. All right, here are a few  
people, a few case studies that I want you all to listen to.  
No fluff, real testimonial. Shout out to Lynette Wheaton for showing me and hundreds of other  
people her unlicensed Groupon share living model that has allowed me to become a successful  
operator to the point that I was able to leave my nine to five job. And not only that, this  
unlicensed Groupon model has allowed me to use it to facilitate me to get to my unlicensed  
youth Groupon that I am currently working on as we speak.  
So I just wanna say, Lynette, appreciate you for this model. I did not even know this model  
existed until I met you. And when I seen you doing what you was doing, I'm like, oh yeah, this is  
a great way to get in to not only create generational wealth for myself and my family, but to  
impact those who are in need in the community.  
I'm Dee in Charlotte, North Carolina. I just wanna let you know that if you have not already  
purchased your ticket to next conference, Groupon for Newbies, you are missing out. The gems  
that they drop are amazing.  
Like money cannot afford it, seriously. So if you haven't already purchased, if you haven't  
already purchased your ticket and there are no more slots available, then you need to contact  
her for consultation because she's the bomb.com. Thank you guys. Hi everybody, I'm Justin, I'm  
from Milwaukee.  
I came all the way here to Charlotte to learn from the Groupons for Newbies conference. It was  
fantastic. There was so much learning over the last two days.My fingers are sore from trying to type out all the notes on my laptop. I had the voice recorder  
going. It was raining gold nuggets everywhere.  
So definitely got a lot of information to change my business with and do things that I've been  
wanting to do with it. And you can have the same thing too. So there's probably very limited  
seats left at the remaining conferences.  
You need to get signed up for them if you're at all serious about this conference. Thank you.  
And I also have one of my very first mentees on the call, Mr. McKell Mitchell.  
I want him to come unmute to talk about his experience as well with using MyBlueprint to be  
able to change his business because when he first got started, he started out as a co-living  
operator. When most of you may have heard of people who open up homes and they do it the  
single room occupancy method. And so that's how McKell first got started with I guess the  
shared room business model before me introducing him to my model.  
So McKell, are you here? I absolutely am. How are you today? I'm fine. How are you? I'm fine.  
Can you talk a little bit about the difference in co-living and like the group home model that I've  
introduced to you? Man, how much time do I have? You ain't got much. So what a lot of people  
don't realize is that shared living and co-living is different, right? And I didn't realize that, you  
know, it took me about eight months into your mentorship because from the very beginning I  
came in with, I wouldn't say doubt, but I came in with this certainty that we were both doing the  
same thing and that there wasn't anything to learn so much from your group, but I just  
followed. I mean, not so much as anything to learn from the group because I did from the  
beginning knew that it could be something I could learn, but I just felt like we were already  
doing the same thing.  
So in that regards, there was nothing to learn. But what I discovered after eight months of  
going back and forth with you when you kept telling me that there was a difference, my mind  
could not wrap itself around the fact that you were correct. And after some time it clicked,  
right? Because I came to realize that, especially after coming to Houston and touring your  
group homes, that there was a huge difference.  
And that difference was that in the co-living model, we are primarily attracting workforce  
people, right? Co-living and shared living in the sense that Houston and Atlanta and other  
places are different in the sense that co-living attracts workforce people. Workforce people who  
makes three times, usually three times the income, who have decent credit, who have no felony  
backgrounds or minor criminal background. It's just that, and then the rules and procedures  
are different.  
It's like everything is just different primarily because it's workforce. But when I came over to the  
group home model, I realized that your way absolutely eliminates all the barriers to housing  
that exists in the co-living model. And this, some people believe that just the affordability ofhousing is just the numbers or the price of the room or the price of the accommodation.  
But affordability is the elimination of the barriers that prevent people from moving in. Because  
like you just alluded to, homeless doesn't mean incomeless. So some people make enough  
money, but because of the barriers that are there in the co-living model, even with that, they  
can't get into these rooms.  
So your model actually changed my perspective and allowed me to open up and entertain other  
people, other demographics that just absolutely doubled my income when I started applying  
your method. So there is a great difference and I appreciate you for sharing that with me and  
going back and forth with me for that eight months until I figured it out. Thank you for that,  
Mikhail.  
Yes, absolutely. All right, so the net effect. Launch your very first group home in 45 days without  
owning a property, without getting licensed or guessing what to do next.  
Here's what you'll get. So I have a core trainings with step-by-step videos, the bread room lead  
scripts, the house setup guide, onboarding templates, landlord goldmine bonus and a 30-day  
game plan bonus. And so those things total up to $5,082.  
But for today, I will be able to let you all access my course for 997\. And so you can start for as  
low as $65 a month with the buy now pay later options. And one thing about it, when I talk  
about my business model, I am 1000% certain if you apply what I tell you to apply that you will  
be able to be successful in this business.  
So that's why I offer a money back guarantee if you do the work and it doesn't pay off. I'll  
refund you, but you gotta show up and you have to apply. When you're doing your cold calls  
and you are out making these new connections with different individuals, letting them know  
about your business and what kind of homes you have in the community, you will get different  
social workers, case managers and discharge planners that's interested in your services.  
One thing about it, when they have people who are hospitalized and they need to be able to get  
discharged, if they do not have a place to stay, the hospital, their insurance does not pay rent,  
right? So once they've reached their baseline and they can be discharged from the hospital, the  
insurance, the money is cut out. People are in beds, whether it's the hospitals, mental health  
hospitals, nursing homes, rehabs that was supposed to be there temporarily, but due to the  
fact that once they leave there, they did not have a place to go, they're still somewhere  
discharged while the social workers are facing challenges with not having enough housing  
opportunities to be able to meet these individuals income. And one thing about it, those that  
are low income is like hanging fruit from a tree because most of these bigger housing settings,  
they may charge anywhere between three to $4,000 a month, right? And so most people who  
are on SSI, which is Supplemental Security Insurance, they only get $967 a month.  
So the people, when they call these licensed assisted living facilities or these senior placementsand things like that, they just don't meet the income qualification. And so one of the many  
reasons why I was able to scale my business to a half a million dollars is, is because of volume. I  
have a lot of beds, right? And so we're targeting people who average anywhere between the  
967 up to about $2,800 a month.  
That's pretty much the good sweet spot for those who are low income. Anyway, well, I would  
say 967 to about $3,200 a month. People who make more than 967 are people who paid into  
social security.  
Many of you should know that if you work a job, you'll have withholdings. And so on your W-2  
paycheck stub, you'll see where you have social security and Medicare withholdings, right? And  
so that's the money that I'm talking about with the low income population. Those that worked  
and invested into social security or put into social security and met their 40 quarters, they have  
a little bit more money than those who are on SSI.  
People who are on SSI are people who never worked a job or they didn't meet the 40 quarters.  
So the government says, if you are blind, disabled or aged, aged being 65 years and older, we  
will give you a supplemental security income, which is the 967\. And so one of the things that I  
want to be able to help you all wrap your mind around, I want you to write this down.  
If you are familiar with a chat GPT cloud or any other AI resources, you can put this in, ask AI,  
how many, matter of fact, let me check this out. I want people to Google our AI while we on this  
call and I want you to drop the answer in the chat. Ask AI, how many social workers are in the  
state of, and put your state, put your state.  
Ask AI right now, how many social workers are in the state of, and put your state and then drop  
the answer in the chat. Ooh, slow feet don't eat. I know y'all can do it faster than that.  
Cause one thing that you all are gonna learn about me is I'm big on statistics. I'm big on  
research. I don't do anything in my business that I don't research first.  
Next question, ask AI, how many people who are incarcerated whether it's, it's gonna probably  
take you a little bit more time to type this one out. Whether it's state jail, federal prison, state  
prison, or county jails. How many people in my state are being released from an incarcerated  
institution? Let's go on a monthly basis.  
Let's go on a monthly basis. How many people are returning home from an institutional setting  
each month in this state? Y'all may say, oh, these are big numbers, big numbers. All right,  
scratch all of that, scratch all of that.  
Matter of fact, just stop typing in the chat right now. Stop typing in the chat. What I want you to  
do now is ask ChatGPT roughly how many people in my state are on SSI? Drop those numbers  
in.  
I wanna know how many people in your state is on SSI? How many people in your state are onSSI, just SSI? And again, SSI is a guaranteed check that people get from the federal government  
if they have a disability, if they have, if they are blind and if they are aged, which is 65 years and  
older. And when I say disability, that could be a physical disability, a medical disability, or  
physical, medical, or mental disability. So for those, for just that group of people in the world,  
SSI is for those individuals.  
All right, scratch that, scratch that, scratch that. Ask, ask ChatGPT how many people in my state  
are on Social Security Retirement Benefits? How many people in my state are on just Social  
Security Retirement Benefits? And so I'm not, I ain't convincing nobody or nothing. I'm just  
letting you look at the numbers.  
I want you to look at the numbers because when you see the number of people in your state  
that has guaranteed income, I'm not talking about people that's working a job. I'm talking  
about people that got a guaranteed check every single month. These are the numbers that you  
all are posted in the chat.  
These are the numbers that you all are posted in the chat. And we just gonna keep narrowing it  
down because seeing is believing. I don't want you to hear from me.  
I want you to see it for yourself. Anytime you open up a business, you have to do your market  
research. You have to do a market analysis to be able to understand what the needs are in your  
state, in your area, and in your local community.  
When I'm getting ready to market my business, I go out in a 50 mile radius. I don't do nothing. I  
go and get people from rural areas, rural areas that don't have access to public transportation,  
rural areas that don't have access to different primary care physicians, rural areas that don't  
have access to different dialysis clinics.  
They have to go near and far to be able to get different resources. I go and pull those seniors  
from those communities and let them know that, hey, I have properties around the Houston  
metro area and we're near the medical center with different medical professionals that I can  
get you connected to with your insurance to take you to and from your doctor's appointment. I  
have primary care physicians that'll come into the house if you don't wanna go into office.  
I have different wraparound services such as home health and home care to be able to bring in  
caregivers for you seven days a week, as well as provide physical therapy, occupational therapy,  
and speech therapy if you need those services. So I make sure I cast a wide net when I'm  
marketing my business. Last thing I want you to ask, XChatGPT, how many people in my city? So  
we're not even talking about the state right now.  
We're talking about the city. How many people in my city? So put your city. So I would say how  
many people in the city of Houston is on guaranteed, have guaranteed income, but no place to  
go, no place to live? So how many people in your city are on fixed income, have guaranteed  
income, but they are at risk of homelessness? What y'all come up with? Because one thing y'allneed y'all to know is this data that y'all are dropping in, this data is not data that is flying out  
the thin air.  
Every city do a count. That's how it's being pulled. We even have where you, let's just say at the  
end of the year, we volunteer to go out and count the homeless populations and just comb in  
the streets of different homeless population.  
Everybody got to submit their own data to get the census of these homeless population. That's  
where all of these things are coming from. It ain't coming from, you know, ChatGPT thinking he  
just, it is just smart, right? These things are data that's being collected.  
And so you put your city, but you can go all the way out into a 50 mile radius, like I was  
mentioning earlier, and see how many people have that need. And all you need out of the  
number of people that y'all done posted in my chat, all you need to get started and start cash  
flowing, and even to making up to a half a million dollars a year like me is 48 people. I keep my  
sights on the numbers.  
I don't care what's going on around me. I don't care how many of my group homes for  
newbies, cousins in Houston opened up homes. I don't care what's going on because all I need  
to know is, and I'm gonna get y'all to put one more statistic in this chat.  
All I need to know is how many social workers in my area, how many case workers are in my  
area, how many discharge planners are in my area, how many people are releasing from prison  
in my area, how many people are on SSI in my area, how many people are on social security  
benefits in my area. Once I got that number and it's showing me thousands and thousands,  
can't nobody tell me my business model don't work. It's my job as the business owner to go out  
and find those people in my community.  
If the data say in Houston, there are 3000 social workers in my area, it is Lynette's job to make  
sure Lynette connect with the 3000 people in her city. If Lynette only found five, Lynette is  
doing herself a disservice. So when I share information with you all and when I tell you, hey, my  
model work, I'm not going based off of I was lucky, right? This wasn't pure luck for me.  
This was years and years of research and this was years and years of understanding my  
population. Years and years knowing who's gonna give me these individuals. Years and years of  
learning how to make connections and how to nurture relationships and how to provide value  
to my referral partners.  
Last question I wanna ask you all to look up. Ask ChatGPT, how many people in my state have  
100%, well, not 100%. How many people in my state have a VA disability rating? How many  
people in my state have a disability rating through the VA? How many people in my state have a  
VA disability rating? I wanna see.  
Because this is different from SSI. This is different from social security. This is another  
guaranteed income, 1.1. 1.3. Millions in your state.I only touch people who have guaranteed income. If somebody contact me and tell me they  
work a job, baby, I'm gonna have to refer you out to somebody else. I want people who have a  
guaranteed check every single month.  
Moving on. I know you may be thinking, I don't have experience. Y'all, I didn't have experience  
either.  
I was just a former correctional officer that saw a problem and wanted to be able to provide a  
solution. And I'm gonna say, I made a mistake and grew my business to a half a million dollars  
because when I got started with this business, I wasn't thinking about how much money I was  
gonna make. I was thinking about, damn, these are the very people that I have to do security  
checks on every 30 minutes.  
I have to actually go around and count living and breathing bodies every two hours. When they  
want their channel changed, I have to go get up and change the channel for them. If they  
wanna play a board game, I have to go and put the board game pieces out.  
If they have to go eat, go to the chow hall, I have to release them. I have to pop the gate. I have  
to be the one who take them out for recreation.  
I'm dealing with these guys every single day. Like they used to tell me when I was working as a  
CO, they used to say, Officer Russia, you crazy as hell. You choose to be locked up.  
We ain't got no choice. Why the hell you up in here with us and you choosing this? Because I  
was behind the key too. I had to not have access to my phone.  
I was just like the head inmate because we had to get the gate popped first to walk out. And if a  
riot went on, we didn't go home. But anyway, needless to say, that these were the individuals  
that I was working with for years.  
You know, I made sure that I was firm, fair, and consistent with everything that I did while  
working my job. And when it was time for me to get a slip to be able to tell somebody, hey, you  
know, basically pack up. Get these little chain bags, do their inventory to get them out of there.  
It was some sad faces. People wasn't really excited about having to face what was to come,  
which is, I ain't gonna find no job. Ain't nobody finna let me live with them.  
My kids don't talk to me. My parents said that, Officer Russia, I'll be back. Like it wasn't, these  
things were not easy for my heart to be able to witness that these guys was going through.  
And I said, I'm finna figure out a way to be able to get them out, get them home, and be able to  
provide this for them. Y'all, I wasn't looking to make a whole lot of damn money. Yeah, I needed  
to be able to make enough money to pay the bills.  
I was good with just $500. That was more than, listen, my damn check at the job wasn't but  
$2,000, $2,300 a month. So if I made an extra $500, you know, helping these guys, it didn'tmatter to me.  
But fortunately, while doing this, while seeing the need, while being able to have my  
heartstrings pulled by this population, it has been good to me. It has been good to me. So  
when you lead with your ministry, with a mission, and you lead with purpose, and you have  
your heart into it, the money is gonna come.  
It's gonna be overflow. Because at the end of the day, we are all God's children. And the minute  
that somebody is released from prison or somebody has did what they need to do to make  
parole, I'm not the one that's standing there that's gonna continue to judge them.  
I am someone who wholeheartedly believes that once somebody pays their dues to society,  
that's it. That's it. If the government or the people that hold the keys did not feel like this person  
should deserve their freedom, they would never make parole.  
If these people did not deserve their freedom, they would never get discharged from their  
sentence. Because understand that when people are incarcerated, if they do stupid shit in the  
penitentiary, they catch charges like in the free world. There's things that they can do inside the  
penitentiary to catch a new charge and have their sentence extended.  
You might say, well, I don't have a property. So I'll teach you how to rent your property first. I'll  
teach you how to use what you got right now to get what you need to go.  
Even if you feel like, hey, well, I ain't got enough money to pay no deposit in first month rent.  
You know, I'm just trying to get by myself. That's okay.  
Because when you get that good old income tax if you working next year, we gonna upgrade  
your house. If you in a three bedroom, we gonna go in a four bedroom. Might even go to a five  
bedroom.  
Ain't nothing but two, $300 more for extra room in the house. And we gonna house hack. We  
gonna house hack.  
We gonna bring people in like Lynette did. Fill those two rooms up with four people. Let them  
stay there two, three months to be able to get your deposit in first month rent.  
Now you go and use that money, pay for your deposit first month rent and that house is  
already cash flowing because you finna bring the people out your personal home and put them  
in there. And understand when I got started, I started out with only thinking that everybody  
had SSI until I started learning the social security and how people qualify and how much money  
that is and what the VA disability checks were depending on the disability rate. You can pull up,  
I dropped this free gem.  
Pull up the VA disability rate and payee charts. You know what they get? They get 10%, 20%,  
30%, 40%, 50%, 60, 70, 80, 100\. Pull up that chart.They don't need the full 100\. I'll take me a 70 any day. And you might be scared, right? This is  
normal.  
But guess what? Fear doesn't pay bills. Fear doesn't help people in your community have access  
to essentially what human beings should be able to have access to. And that's a roof over their  
head.  
So I also have bonuses, right? So for those of you who are ready to act and build a business that  
makes money while making a difference, number one, you'll get my first 30 days action plan, a  
day-by-day checklist that tells you exactly what to do from the moment you join until your first  
resident move in. Whoa, walk them. Hey, hey, hey.  
Oh, fuck them up. Hey, walk them, walk, oh, yeah. Oh, walk them, hey.  
Number two, my ebook on how to do a market analysis. So basically how to find what's exactly  
needed in your area. So of course, you know, part of the market analysis is seeing what the hell  
is going on, right? Seeing who needs what, how much money is out there, where I'm gonna get  
the people from.  
I already gave you step one of a market analysis, but there's so much more to come with doing  
a market analysis, because even though we have the numbers on where we need to get these  
people from and everything like that, we need to know how to get there. We need to know how  
to bring them on in. We need to know how to make the connections, what to say, how to follow  
up and things like that.  
And so you will also get my ebook on how to do a market analysis. Coffee every morning like  
you like it? No, I do. Yeah, we got some more coffee today.  
How are you gonna help somebody you ain't got but one leg? Shit, who the fuck you talking to?  
You talking to. Bonus number three, lifetime updates to all materials. So as you know, I go  
through my journey, I learn a lot.  
I'm a person that's always a student, always looking to be able to perfect my business, my  
policies, my SOPs, my different systems that I have in place. I'm looking to make sure that I  
continue to work on my business and not in my business. And with working on my business,  
there's a lot of things that I have to bring into play to make sure that I'm not spending time as a  
self-employee.  
I wanna be able to continue to be on the side of the business owner. So being self-employed is  
not the play. I don't like for my hands to feed me.  
So which means that I don't want to have to use my hands in order to make money. I want  
systems to make me money. And I just wanna sit back and watch over everything and make  
sure everything go together, right? So you'll be able to get a lifetime updates to all of my  
material.♪ I woke up this morning with my mind all today ♪ ♪ I woke up this morning with my thoughts

I would've broke it to him. I told him she don't love him. She don't love him.  
He was on the street. I'm not putting him back on the street. He was gonna have to fight with  
me.  
I would. You. I know.  
I had my hair cut, now. You mean tell your brother your hair is cut? Yeah. I had to get him a, I  
had to send a picture.  
You see yourself? Yeah. You look handsome. Yeah.  
You glad you got your hair cut? Yeah. That's good. I'm gonna bring you a watch tomorrow.  
I miss my dog, man. You miss your dog? Yeah. We'll have to get you another one.  
Yeah, you do. Get me a dog while I'm here, man. You need me to get you a dog over here?  
Yeah.  
Okay. Where's your dog, man? He couldn't take care of, I told you he was sick. Oh, man.  
My back. Yeah. He gone old, man.Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm worn. All right, so I put these two videos here because of course you all  
should be able to decipher that.  
These are two of the same, these are the same people. This guy came from Adult Protective  
Services. He was living out in the field homeless.  
He had guaranteed income, but his family did not want to take care of him. So he was living out  
in the field. He called me all kind of black bitches and told me to let him go.  
And we had to grow into loving each other because he wasn't having it. He liked being out in  
the field homeless, but his health was starting to decline and he needed somebody called Adult  
Protective Services on him and another guy. And so I took both of them in.  
And so that was back in 2023\. And I still got him to this day. And no, his family don't check on  
him.  
He still call, he asked about his family, but his family has never been in contact. But I just let him  
know, I just make him feel like, okay, when he tell me to call his sister, I'll say, okay, I'll call her  
or tell my brother something. Okay, I'll let him know, you know, just things like that.  
But he of course have IDD, but he's been with me long term. I am his rep payee and yeah, he  
don't give me no problems. So your price today is only 997 with a money back guarantee.  
I got three people in wheelchairs. What's up? What's up? I got it. Mendoza, don't pay him no  
mind.  
All three of those guys came from the Department of Corrections. Two of the three are  
individuals who have sex related crimes. They are all been with me for years.  
I'm showing this display of the people on these videos so that you can see the type of people  
that can live in an unlicensed home, regardless if they're using a wheelchair, a walker or a  
rollator, or, you know, just using their two feet. As long as individuals are capable of self  
evacuating in the event of an emergency, they can be in an unlicensed home. As long as people  
are able to identify who they are and where they are, they can be in an unlicensed home.  
So they have to be have, you know, cognitive impairments that are good enough to be able to  
basically live without care. So one common concern is, are non-licensed group homes legal?  
And again, for those of you, I don't care what state you're in, you can operate a home that does  
not require a license as long as the individuals in the home are able to self evacuate and they  
do not require 24 hour care and supervision. You are able to have an unlicensed home.  
And if somebody do need certain assistance with their ADLs, you're able to bring in third party  
organizations to be able to fill those needs, such as like the non-medical home care agency that  
I have, where I have caregivers come in to assist those that may need a few tasks handled. And  
so if you all know, I have my non-medical home care license here in the state of Texas aboveour home care. It is a separate entity.  
The entity is only to provide caregiving services. It's different from my group home business  
where we only just charge for a place to stay. Okay.  
Hey. Okay. All right.  
So I am dropping the link to the course in the chat so that you all will be able to have access to  
purchase the course tonight. And also I wanna share my contact information. For those of you  
who have some additional questions about the course, my team will be able to answer  
questions, whether you are having questions about the course, whether it's regarding my  
mentorship offers or questions about the two-day conference.  
You can write this number down. And again, my team is only going to respond to questions  
related to the course, anything regarding my mentorship or the two-day conference. Anything  
outside of that will not get a response.  
Utilize the Facebook community to ask any other questions. The phone number is going to be  
in the chat right now. There's the number for support for those of you who have any questions  
related to the course.  
But I can't say everything that you need from A to Z to get started with your unlicensed  
business is in the course. But if you have any kind of questions or concerns, you can reach out  
there. Here's the remaining conferences that we have for the year.  
We have Chicago, Illinois, July 25th and 26th, Meridian, Mississippi, August 8th and 9th,  
Charlotte, North Carolina, August 22nd and 23rd. You can go on  
www.grouphomesfornewbies.com to be able to purchase your ticket to the course. Now, I  
mean, to the conference.  
Now I can say the conference link, the site is down. My tech guy is currently working on it now.  
So the conference will be available to resume purchasing.  
I don't know, today something happened, but tomorrow you will be able to resume purchasing  
these final stops. And so at this time, I'm going to drop the link in the chat for those of you who  
want to take advantage of the course and get started today. There's the link.  
Nick. Hey. Hey, I'm listening to you and I'm just, I think for me, as I remember when I first  
started and I think when I look back at having been, having you come to Atlanta in the  
beginning when we were trying to convert over to trying to, I guess, kind of like copy your  
model and having all of those conversations.  
So it's just recently the coursework as a mentee, I've read the coursework and I believe that had  
I had this in the very beginning, to be honest, had I had this in the very beginning, and because  
I'm such an action taker, it would have probably, it would have given me a different perspective.Hell, I wouldn't have paid you all that money, honestly, to probably come here and do the  
walkthroughs and everything with me because I would have probably figured it out. I probably  
would have still had problems and issues along the way.  
And I think that the mentorship would have helped me, but to read through this course and to  
see exactly and to have it right in front of me, I think that was the biggest thing for me, having  
it, to read this and to be able to have everything that you've said to me over the course of the  
eight months, but to be able to look at it, to read it and go back over it and just kind of like  
ruminate on it, I think that that would have definitely benefited me more. So I think for you  
designing this course and having a lot of newbies in the group, and especially the newbies that  
are action takers, I think that this course is definitely, it's definitely gonna be a game changer  
for them. So I don't know, I mean, I think it's brilliant to actually do a course, to actually to do it.  
Well, look, this, in addition to the conference, cause the conference would reinforce this. When I  
look at this now from where I am now, and I look back at this, the conference, the mentorship,  
it's like, I don't see how anyone could possibly miss. At the conferences, one of the things I like  
about the conferences is that we get different perspective from different people in the group  
home space, but in the unlicensed group home space, the information is reinforced.  
Everything that you're saying now, and I still believe that there's some secret sauce to this. If  
those who are, cause it's like a code you have to break. And I think that's where my mind shift  
came in at, when I was able to break that code, that was right before my face.  
It was right before my face, but I just could not see it coming from a co-living position. I think  
that as an, and I wouldn't even consider myself a newbie, right? Even though I had been doing  
it for a while, I was a newbie when it came to the group home model. And when I broke the  
code, it just like, now I'm able to articulate it.  
I'm even able to go on tour and not with you, and not even just talk about that experience, but  
to be able to expound on the things that I've learned along this journey from my perspective.  
And when I read the course that you did, I was able to see everything that I now know  
encapsulated inside the course. So I think the course is absolutely the game changer in my  
opinion.  
And I think that many other people, once they read this course and maybe attend a conference  
to have it reinforced, I think, or even not even so much as the conference, but continue to get in  
the chat and put action behind, I mean, get in the group and the feeds and stuff and put action  
behind it, whether that's getting out everyday marketing, becoming a referral agent or  
consultant, and then even watching the videos and the videos that you have out, all of the  
videos, the bed filling series and the other videos, it changes an action taker, in my opinion, it  
definitely changed the action taker. So I appreciate you for putting this out, but, and I also see a  
lot of the conversations that we've had as well as not just you and I, but conversations that you  
and I and Don, you and I and Dion have had about this. I appreciate the fact that you listened to  
the fact that we were talking about, hey, it needs to be a little bit more clearer or a little bitmore layman.  
I mean, even though you are, you just, you speak in a raw terms to help us understand, but  
sometimes for those of us who have no experience, it could be a little bit daunting, a little bit  
confusing, even when it's raw and right before our face, because of the perspective that we  
come from, from the mindset that we come from, that which should be obvious, isn't always so  
obvious. So after reading it, seeing how you revised it, I just wanna say, I definitely appreciate  
it. And I think that many people will benefit from this.  
And I think it's gonna go a long way in really educating people on this model, not just the  
people that want to do it, not just the people that are standing on the sidelines, but those who  
are like social workers, caseworkers, discharge managers, who actually begin to become more  
aware of our model and understand that this ain't just something fly by night. This is something  
that has been, and it's not something that is new. I think that what you did was, I think that  
what you did is simplify it from a bigger model to a smaller model that applies to the home, to  
the houses.  
And that was, once these other institutions or other people, agencies, understand that this is  
not a fly by night type thing. This is something that was carefully thought out and we're  
definitely trained in the model itself. I think that it is going to grab more attention and we all  
are going to be able to benefit from, as they call it, the senior tsunami that's coming along.  
So yeah, I definitely appreciate you for that. Oh, we didn't even talk about the senior tsunami.  
That's another statistic that they need to be aware of.  
How many people per day turning 65 in the next few years? Right. Every day. Tell them to put it  
in the chat.  
Right, put that in chat, GPT. How many people each day through 2031 are turning 65 in the  
United States? Put that statistic in, find that statistic, just to see how good the odds are in your  
favor when it comes to people with guaranteed income. When it comes to people- Because like  
I told y'all earlier, if you get at least SSI, you have to be 65 years or older.  
So look at that statistic. How many people in the U.S. turn 65 years old every single day? Matter  
of fact, ask chat, GPT, when, at what year will the Baby Boomers generation expire or transition  
out? At what year will the Baby Boomers generation transition out? Put that in the chat. And so  
Baby Boomers are turning 65 every single day.  
I just want to see what numbers y'all come up with. And I know the numbers. I know it.  
I want to see what they coming up with. 65 years or older in the U.S., if you are a U.S. citizen,  
you will get guaranteed income. Oh, I'd have got to open up the chat.  
I'm sorry, y'all. There you go. Fire away.What's your numbers? Bingo. Tanya. Like you cannot miss with my business model.  
All right, let's- 2040, come on now. 2040\. How many more years is that done? By my count, we  
got about 15 more years.  
And we got a couple leap years in there. So we got 15 years and a couple of days. Like if you  
only targeted seniors, the Baby Boomer generation is one of the mass populations out of World  
War II, where they coming home from the military and just popping babies left and right.  
Left and right. You can't miss. Shoot a bullet, have a baby.  
That was the model back then. They must've given us some good tax returns up there. Guys,  
what I want y'all to hear more than anything, man, because I'm gonna be real with y'all.  
Whenever I first came on and was starting up before NET got started, I was dog tired. Dog  
tired. I woke up at like, what? NET probably like 2.30 this morning first.  
Went back to sleep for a little bit. Was back up at four o'clock. I've been going since four o'clock  
this morning.  
All right, been in the conference all day yapping, talking to people, going back and forth with  
people. Went through an hour and a half of traffic to come back home and get started with y'all  
tonight. So I was dead tired, but NET's energy transferred over to me because I genuinely get  
excited whenever other people get the opportunity to embark on their dreams, embark on  
their journey, embark on something that they haven't done before.  
And I know that there's a proven blueprint in which all you really gotta do is follow it. Dion, put  
your information in the chat, bro. Somebody asking for you.  
The mercy child is asking for your information. And so, guys, I've had multiple businesses that  
have earned seven figures. And through that, this is what I want you guys to know.  
Entrepreneurship as a whole sucks 80% of the time. All right, 80% of the time, it sucks. We don't  
do it for the 80, because that 20 feel like 10,000.  
That 20%, that feeling of euphoria, of being able to serve somebody else, being able to do what  
you love, being able to have what we call the four freedoms. All right? Everybody is doing  
something more or less because of the four freedoms. You want freedom of time.  
You want freedom of money. You want freedom of expression to be able to do what you want.  
You want freedom of relationships.  
All right? Those more than likely are the four reasons, the four freedoms that you are looking  
for when you're embarking on this journey. And as I was in traffic this morning, going to the  
conference that I was at, I was listening to some different podcasts. And one of the people that  
was on the podcast made the statement, all human behavior is driven by the desire to escapediscomfort.  
Okay? All human behavior is driven by the desire to escape discomfort. That discomfort can be  
discomfort in the way you look. If you don't like, so for me, I'm in the gym every day.  
Why? Because a few months ago, about a year ago, I didn't like the way I looked. That was a  
discomfort for me. Your finances aren't where you want them to be.  
Your finances are not comfortable for you right now. And so therefore, I wanted to do  
something about it. You want to do something about it.  
All right? So think of the areas in your life where you have discomfort. That discomfort is what's  
going to drive you to do what it is that you need to do. So can anybody, like, can anybody tell  
me the opposite of distractions? What's the, and you put in the chat, what's the opposite of  
distractions? Okay, I hear focused.  
Focus, focus, focus, focus. Everybody's saying focus, focus. Those are really good answers.  
But they're incorrect. All right? So in order to know what that is, we have to understand exactly  
what distraction is. Distraction comes from a Latin word, and the root of that Latin word means  
to pull away from.  
Okay, to pull away from. So a distraction is something that pulls you away from something that  
you desire, something that you want. So the opposite of distraction is traction.  
Traction is to pull you towards something that you want. All right? Traction is to pull you  
towards something that you want. So right now, in order to do this business, let me tell you  
guys something from an entrepreneur's playbook really quick.  
All right? You are going to have to limit your distractions, limit the things that pull you away  
from what you desire and what you want in life. And you're gonna have to find what gives you  
traction. All right? You're gonna have to find what gives you the traction that you're looking for,  
what pulls you toward what it is that you're looking for in life, what it is that you say that you  
desire.  
So right now, my biggest distraction is probably this, this right here. This stops me, right now,  
this right here stops me from doing a lot of the things that I feel that I should be doing during  
the day from time to time. All right? That's me being honest with me.  
Okay? This right here. So what do I need to do? If I know that this is my biggest distraction, this  
pulls me away from what it is that I need to be doing, then I need to one, turn off notifications.  
Because every time this thing buzzes or dings, it's like, I'm a crack head in this free crack.  
I'm picking it up and I'm getting my hit. I gotta see what it is. Most people are like that as well.  
So you need to have, when we're starting on this journey, guys, have an honest opinion withyourself. What are your distractions? What pulls you away from the desire that you have to do  
this business effectively? And then find a way to make it harder to get to that distraction. Or get  
away, I'm sorry, get to stay away from that distraction.  
Find like, find a way. Turn notifications off. Turn Facebook off during the day.  
Turn Instagram off. Have a designated time to check your email. On top of that, put this  
statement in your mind.  
I'll get to it in 10 minutes. Anytime that you feel that you are getting ready to have a distraction  
or a distraction is coming about to you, tell yourself, I will get to it in 10 minutes. Now, does that  
tell our mind that we can't have the distraction at all? No.  
It's letting our mind know that we're in control of it and saying, hey, I'm not going to go away  
and go to it right now. I'm gonna have some willpower and I'll get to it in 10 minutes. Those  
micro 10 minute steps that you're taking allow you to have control over your distractions.  
Why am I telling you guys this right now? Well, because there's a course in this link right here,  
in the chat, that some of you are signing up for right now. And as you are signing up and  
paying your money for this course, whether you paying it all up front or you're gonna be paying  
it over time, you more than likely, if you're not in control of your distractions, when you sit  
down to do this course and start to do the work, your distractions are gonna pull you away  
from it. And what's gonna happen is, you're gonna come back here in a month, you're gonna  
come back here in 45 days and you're not gonna be any further along than where you were  
tonight because you allowed your distractions to stop your traction.  
Guys, entrepreneurship and personal development were two of the best things I could have  
ever given myself and allowed my family, my kids, my wife to be the beneficiaries of. I did this  
for me and they are the beneficiaries of it. This is me working my ass off like this is my life  
insurance policy that I get to have living benefits with.  
So in the chat right now, if you ready to get started and you trying to do something right now,  
put your why in the chat. Put your, why are you doing this? Put your why in the chat. Why am I  
telling you to put your why? Because you gotta have a burning desire to get started with  
something like this.  
You gotta have a burning desire to change your life. Several years ago, I had a burning desire to  
change my life. My first burning desire was to stop drinking.  
I was an alcoholic. I made five years of sobriety on the inmate. I became a better businessman,  
a better husband, a better father, a better person, a better philanthropist.  
Everything about me became better because I made a decision for me and allowed everybody  
else around me to be the beneficiary of it. I knew my why. Financial freedom.Change my life and move abroad. Create generational wealth. Financial freedom, a desire to  
help others.  
Leave a legacy. Generational wealth. Tired, ready for change, fed up.  
Good. Be fed up today, be fed up tomorrow. I'm letting y'all know.  
Like, I didn't did it. I didn't seen it. And so because of that, because of what Lynette has done,  
because of what I've done, because of what Will has done and Dion has done and Mikkel has  
done and some of the others that you're gonna meet along the way, that is what lets me know  
that all of you can do it too.  
We ain't nothing special. We didn't do anything special. We just got tired enough of the same  
old shit that we wanted something new.  
Outside of Don Rich, guys, I'm letting y'all know I go by the name The Attitude Alchemist  
because it's my job to turn your base mindset into a mindset of goal so that you can change,  
turn your current reality into your desired reality. Nothing that we've done is special. We've just  
consistently made small mistakes and small successes until they added up.  
The mistakes started to go down and the successes started to add up. But what we didn't do  
was quit. We might've bitched and moaned a little bit, but we ain't quit.  
Let's see, you're tired of making somebody else wealthy and you're unappreciated. So let me  
tell you something, okay? The more that you keep saying that you're unappreciated, that's all  
the universe gonna give you back. All right, that's all it's gonna give you back.  
Stop telling yourself that story. I understand what you're saying. You feel unappreciated, but  
you have to feel like what you want.  
Because if you feel like what you don't want, you're gonna get more of what you don't want. So  
don't tell yourself that story. Just say, hey, my worth is more than what I'm getting for it right  
now.  
You gotta replace those words a little bit. I'm not unappreciated, my worth is more. So now the  
universe just knows to give you more for what your worth is.  
Word play language. Language is the most powerful tool that we have and we misuse it all the  
time. We start misusing it up here and then we repeat the process out here.  
We have to make sure that we understand exactly that what the words are that we're putting  
out. And that starts with the words that we're thinking. Sheree, go ahead.  
I'm sorry. I get a little wired sometimes, man. I appreciate you.  
Hey, I see you taking notes and shit and everything, man. Look, I can go after I get started. Noproblem.  
I'm new. Today is my first day. Learned so much.  
Welcome to the circus. Thank you. I don't know if Lynette know me by now, but I've been  
stalking her.  
I've been stalking her for the last 48 hours. And no, you got back to me. I know you're busy.  
My question was, so tonight this, I'm just gonna round it to $1,000. That, how does that relate  
to the conference? So I know that there's different levels. I saw 3,500.  
I saw 6,500. So I'm just trying to see the course. Is that included in those mentorships? Within  
those, the 3,500 and the 6,500, and what's the difference? And if you purchase it, can it be used  
towards the Chicago conference this weekend? Yeah, so good questions.  
All right, so the course is simply, like if you looked on my, so you went to  
www.grouphomesfornewbies to find that information. And so you might've saw one that says  
the self-starter for 2,500. Well, the self-starter is actually my course that I am running basically a  
special on between through the end of August at 997\.  
So my course package is actually $2,500, right? So the course is just simply the course. But if  
you do the hybrid, which is the 3,500, that's where we'll meet on Zoom as a group. You get the  
option to also attend the conference for no additional charge.  
And the course is also included in that. So the difference is from just having the course and  
going up a step to the hybrid is being able to meet with me each week and to have that  
ongoing support and brainstorming and masterminding and being able to be able to get into a  
conference while it lasts because that bonus for the conference is not going to last very long  
because we're coming to an end August 22nd, 23rd. The VIP is being able to access all of that  
but also being able to schedule one-on-one calls with me throughout your mentorship.  
So hybrid only meets with me via Zoom as a group but the one-on-one mentorship allows you  
to be able to meet with me one-on-one. And with the elite mentorship is all of that plus free  
access to the private school community that I'm rolling out next week as well as me coming to  
your area. So regardless of what city and state you're in, I come in person to help you market  
and help build those relationships in your community.  
So those are the differences but any of the mentorship packages includes the course and it  
includes the conference is while the conference lasts. Okay, and one more question. If you pick  
one and then decide you need to upgrade, can you do that? Do you just pay the difference or  
you have to pick one and stick with it? You can pay the difference.  
Okay, thank you. I will see you this weekend. All righty.  
Ms. Lee. Yes, hi. Thank you guys for the information.I've been in the group for quite some time. So I love, love, love this. What I wanna know is I  
hear you speak a lot about the SSI and guaranteed income.  
Are you gonna teach us about like the waiver programs and some of the other income or  
insurance things that are out there? Or is this the only thing that you mainly use the SSI? Yeah, I  
only do things in a private pay manner because the others require a license. So my homes are  
unlicensed only. Okay, and then my other question is about, I know this is the group home side  
for housing but what about your home health care? If we're interested in that, if we're getting  
one of the packages, will you teach us about that part too? If we wanna add wraparound  
services? Hold on one second, man.  
Hey, how you doing? Okay. How far you gonna walk up to me? Okay, okay, what's up? Well, you  
do know I'm on my Zoom call. So you.  
Okay, let me mute it. Okay. No, I don't mute.  
You might smoke. I don't know if you and your husband smoke and you like weed, but smell it.  
Baby, I don't smoke.  
But do your husband smoke? We sober. I'm sober too. So I don't know if any of you guys are in  
Atlanta cause I work, I do government contracting.  
And so I have three contracts with Fulton County Department of Community Development in  
housing the homeless. So I'm on the back side of things here in Atlanta but I know where the  
gaps and stuff are. And I know who has the money ahead of time as far as them getting the  
grants and everything.  
So I know Ms. Lynette says she does straight SSI but I don't know if any of the other mentors  
are on here if you guys are in that side or do others too but I wanna know Ms. Lynette. All right,  
I'm sorry about that. I gotta get out the, I thought I was out the hood, but.  
So to answer your question, as far as like with the SSI and things like that. So with the  
unlicensed model that's pretty much the only source of income that I receive from individuals  
who either have their own guarantee income or their family members are paying out of pocket  
for them. As far as any other wraparound services where it comes to like the non-medical home  
care I do not have that currently included in my mentorship simply because before I started  
mentoring people are coaching them on different things.  
I like to be able to, you know be able to help navigate any hurdle that come about. And so with  
me only being in the non-medical home care space since February of 2023, no June of 2023 I  
don't feel like I have enough lived experience in different trials and era to be able to coach  
people across the country. I can help Texas, but other states, I won't be able I wouldn't do that.  
So I only make offers on things that I know that, you know it's bulletproof for me to be able to  
help you. Nat, a young lady was just asking about who is in Atlanta and she was asking thequestion about or stating that she had access to funding or know where some of the other  
funding is in terms of the agency. And I didn't catch her name.  
Can you repeat your question or your statement? Did anybody catch her name? You ran away. I  
think it was Ms. Lee. I think it was Mignon Lee.  
She was saying she works with government contracts. Don't run Ms. Lee. I think she had froze  
up too.  
So she probably haven't. Well, Mckay you know we still got to go through the vetting process.  
So you need to just make her contact you and then we can announce.  
Right, I was trying to hear what she was saying in regards to that. So that was gonna be my  
next statement that what she could do is just reach out to me being that I'm here in Atlanta and  
we could have that discussion and possibly, I mean, well, not possibly but have her vetted to  
determine whether or not that is something that we could possibly bring her back on a Zoom  
and have that discussion for those who are available. But with that said, I mean, who would like  
to have who could use that service or that information? But with that said, we had a great meet  
and greet here in Atlanta for the purpose of last weekend.  
Lynette came out and Mr. Lester Young came to really try to ramp up the referral services and  
the networking connections here in Atlanta. But I see in the group, even I was reading in the  
Facebook page earlier, a lot of people are talking about their biggest problem being filling the  
beds. And Lynette, you did a great job.  
And I mean, like a really great job on your bed filling series. So I would advise everyone to, if  
you have not had an opportunity to check out the Bed Filling Series and you're still struggling  
with getting your beds filled, check out the Bed Filling Series that Lynette did. But also, connect  
with those in your area that may already be having a great deal of success in filling the beds.  
But the conferences, networking in different cities, having meetups are very important, but not  
so much as, what I see is that a lot of people come to the networking or even the conferences.  
They come there without having. Don, can you mute that person? Looking for him now.  
Hold on, I'm trying to see which person it is, bro. So it's like, sometimes we come to the group  
or come to these meetups without a lot of information. Again, reading the information in the  
groups is different from having at least gone through whether it's the Bed Filling Series,  
whether it's the, I would highly recommend the, I would deeply, highly recommend, if that's  
even a word, the course.  
Because when you come to these meetups, you actually know now what kind of conversation to  
have. In the court of law, they say if you ask the wrong question, you get the wrong answers.  
And a lot of times we come and we approach people, whether that person is considered a  
group home expert, part of the Lynette circle of experts, we're asking the wrong questions a lot  
of times because we don't properly formulate the questions.So that's why I always say like, even, having gone through some of these Zooms, the free  
Zooms, of course, the conferences, of course, and now definitely the course itself, it actually  
gives you the right questions to ask. So when you're reaching out to one of the experts or when  
you're coming to the conference or when you're coming to the meetup, you're able to articulate  
the questions in a manner that allows you to get the right answers. So that helps to eliminate a  
lot of the confusion.  
As part of the, and Don and Dion and Will and Brandon, part of the Idris, part of Mr. Trump, one  
of the things I love about Ned is that she constantly calls us and talk to us and she gets that  
clarity and you can see it reflected inside the course itself. The beauty is that Ned understands  
that even mentors need mentors. So those conversations are reflected inside her program.  
And when you get that information and you come to these meetups or what have you, you can  
get the information that you, you can ask the right kind of questions to get you the information  
that you need to get started. So yeah, Don? Yes, sir. I know earlier you were, well, not earlier, in  
a previous conversation, you were talking about mindset and how that mindset impacts one's  
ability to eliminate the barriers basically that stymies or creates what we call analysis paralysis.  
In terms of the program that Ned has, how do you think that that contributes to removing the  
barrier or the analysis paralysis? Well, it's very simple, man. Analysis paralysis is caused by an  
overflow of data. And when you have that overflow of data, you have both halves of your mind,  
one side saying you can, the other side being hypervigilant and trying to find all the problems  
in what it is that you're trying to do.  
And most of that comes from one single thing, a lack of confidence. Once you have the  
information right there what happens is you get courage. That courage turns into commitment  
because that courage, all that means is I'm gonna walk through the door and I don't know  
what's on the other side, okay? That when you have information, it allows you to get that little  
bit of courage that says I'm gonna walk through that door and I don't know what's on the other  
side.  
As you continue on getting more and more information, that courage turns into commitment.  
That commitment is gonna tell you I'm gonna walk through that door every single day, even  
though I may not know fully what's on the other side, I'm still gonna walk through that door.  
And then this is really where the course comes into play.  
It increases your capabilities, okay? It increases your capabilities. It increases your marketing  
capabilities. It increases your capabilities to be able to go out and talk to other people that  
might be looking for a home.  
It increases your capabilities to be able to go out and talk to a landlord. It increases your  
capabilities of knowing that not only is this business doable, but that you can do it. And all three  
of those together, the courage, the commitment, and the capabilities all being increased allows  
your confidence to increase.Guys, anytime you get a course, what is going on and what is happening is, and you're actually  
doing a course. Let me state that, because I've spent a lot of money on courses that I didn't,  
that I just spent money.
