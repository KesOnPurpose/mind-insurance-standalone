\[Speaker 1\]  
Yeah. Well, yeah, you go ahead. Introduce yourself, Will.Then we're going to get started.  
\[Speaker 2\]  
Good morning, everyone. I am William Chapman, a third. I started my journey in this group  
home space in general.  
Back in 2023\. I came in trying to pursue a licensed YouTube home. And after 10 months, I had a  
financial barrier.  
Just like most of y'all probably have or will do. Trying to pursue whatever you're trying to  
pursue. And that's when I pivoted to do the unlicensed group home.  
I had met several months before that. In one of our neighborhood groups. And I said, hey, look,  
I want to start this unlicensed space.  
And part of that is because I didn't want to stay stagnant. I wanted to get in where I can at the  
foundational level. And work my way up.  
You know, whether that's, you know, take all the profits from the unlicensed group home and  
reinvest it. You know, just learn the day to day operations of group homes in general. Because  
if nobody knows.  
The unlicensed group home is the foundation to anything you would do. Licensed or  
contracted. So it is a good place to start.  
Started. Went through mentorship. December.  
First. Somewhere around that. December 21st.  
Got the keys to my first home. And yes, I did rent the home. January 1st.  
2024\. I deployed my first home. I opened the doors.  
And I got my first two residents within one week. They both came off the second floor. I mean,  
the same floor.  
Just because. Obviously the case work at that time. Needed two people place.  
So I got a double whammy basically. And. Within 60 days.  
Got my second home. Within five months. Both homes was filled.  
I did stop at two homes because my goal was to only get two homes. Leverage those. While I  
work.  
Try to get business funding. Take those proceeds. The profits and reinvest them so I can buy an  
investment property.And get back to doing a license. So, June 5th, I was able to. Close in on investment property.  
I brought in my partner. That's a. That's a percentage partner in the deal.  
He's not on a car right now. I don't think so. But.  
Got an investment property. June 5th. Here actually.  
October 1st. The tenants that we acquire with the home. We'll be moving out.  
So we'll be starting a process of getting at home. Up and ready to start our license. You do  
youth group home after two years of being set back.  
So. I just want to tell anybody. Anybody coming here on edge.  
Look, you don't get everything you need in here. I am one of the mentors. I am a partner.  
I'm everything and more. You know, to this group, to net, to the team. To the members.  
Come in here and soak this game up and don't be scared. I promise it's enough. It's two years  
worth of information in this group alone for free.  
You just have to go and work with it and look for it. And you can get to wherever you need to  
be. Never.  
It's this group home. Industry to do whatever it is that you want to do. If it's changing your life,  
your family's life.  
Or the people lives that you want to service. So, yeah, if you need anything, you know where to  
find me. I am William Chapman.  
The third on Facebook. You'll see me a lot of part of the comments.  
\[Speaker 7\]  
Thank you. Will.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
All right. All right. So this is what you will learn tonight.  
Hold on one second. Let me. So you'll learn how to.  
Well, let me start over what you'll learn tonight. So we'll be talking about how to start a  
profitable home without a license. How to find people to move in.  
And of course, you don't need any experience on marketing because we teach you that my  
complete blueprint on how to go from 0 to 4 to $7,000 a month worth of cash flow. How to getstarted within the next 45 days. So, who am I?  
My name is Lynette Wheaton. I am out of the Houston metro area. I got started in this business  
back in 2021\.  
I grew my home to seven unlicensed homes across the Houston metro area where I serve  
individuals who are considered underserved individuals in my community as well as individuals  
returning home from prison. I net on average $38,000 a month. I've been helping other people  
launch their group home business across the country since 2022\.  
Of course, I have a community of over 82,000 people and I come with real receipts, real results,  
and real impact. So, those of you that may not know my story, I got started in this business  
after seeing a need for housing for those individuals who were coming home from prison. I  
worked as a correctional officer for four years on three different prison units.  
I was a correctional officer for females and males. One of the things that I observed while  
working as a correctional officer was that there were individuals who were incarcerated that did  
not have a place to go once they made parole or they were discharged in their sentence. One of  
the units that I worked at was a transfer facility.  
With the transfer facility, one of my positions that I had was to inventory their property on the  
way home. So, we had to do an inventory on the way out. Of course, over my course of years as  
a correctional officer, I've heard hundreds of stories.  
Mainly, what I saw so often was people who were getting ready to go home, they were not  
happy. I even had a guy tell me one time, he was like, Officer Russian, I'll be back. I'm like, for  
what?  
That don't make sense. He was just pretty much saying that he didn't have family, he didn't  
have nowhere to go. He was just going to basically get a $50 gate ticket with a button-down  
shirt and some slacks on his way.  
He had been incarcerated for so many years that that was the normal life for him. He didn't  
have anything to look forward to in a free world. He was going to go out and commit a crime to  
be back in the environment that he was used to.  
All because of the lack of resources, the lack of, when they say reducing the revolving doors,  
coming into prison. They didn't really have a program for these individuals. People aren't just  
happy going home.  
The ones that, of course, had some things lined up, they were fine, but the ones that did not  
have anything lined up, it was like a gush of anxiety and depression to even trying to face their  
new reality. Then there was also people that, while incarcerated, had already made parole, had  
their parole certificate, but was still incarcerated because the halfway houses were full. They did  
not have a lot of second chance housing opportunities for these men and women.Can you imagine the mental anguish that these people was experiencing, knowing that they  
could really be free, they could be out of prison, if only they had an address? With me knowing  
that information and me witnessing the men and women being subjected to these kind of  
things after making parole, I wanted to solve a problem, solve a problem. I ended up stopped  
working for the Department of Corrections.  
At the time, years down the line, working another job, stopped working at that job. I had  
decided that instead of me going back to work, I would just focus on the business that I, the  
idea that I had, idea that I once had. I started researching some things, trying to navigate the  
hurdles of a new business owner, doing my research on this particular demographic.  
At the time, I had a four-bedroom house. Three of my bedrooms was empty at the time  
because my children went to Mississippi for the summer. Then, of course, I had a light bulb  
moment.  
I was like, I'm just going to use these empty bedrooms in my house to start generating money,  
bring these people home. When I started marketing my business, I started reaching out to the  
Department of Corrections as well as some referral partners in the community. Since doing  
that, I've just been able to duplicate the process over and over to where I scaled my business.  
In my personal home, at that time, I was charging around $650 a month per bed. I had two  
beds in each room. That was six beds at $650 a month.  
I was bringing in about $3,900 a month from those three bedrooms. My mortgage at the time  
was $1,200. I was covering my mortgage payment.  
I also was averaging about another $500 of overhead costs. This left me with about $2,200 at  
the expenses. Plus, of course, I had my own bedroom in my house in the common areas for me  
to have comfort.  
Now, what I do want to make sure that I do tell people, because I like to let people understand  
that when I first got started on this journey, I did not have a lot of money. I did not have a lot of  
experience, no experience. No experience, and I just went for it.  
It was a passion that I had. It was something that I saw, and I wanted to do something about it.  
I wasn't even really trying to make a whole lot of money doing it because, of course, working a  
job, I was used to my regular salary.  
It just so happened that the demographic that I tapped into and how I was able to scale my  
business, it just so happened that I started making way more than what I was used to making.  
But when I got into the business, I was just looking to replace the income that I was making at  
the time. During that time, like I had led, I wasn't working.  
I had just lost my job. Even though my mortgage payment was $1,200 a month, I had my  
mortgage payment and deferred payments as well as my car note. I really wasn't paying mymortgage or my car because of the forbearance and deferred payment options at the time.  
Of course, I said I started in 2021, so we was in the heart of COVID. I started this business in the  
heart of COVID, and I utilized whatever benefits that I could at the time. Let's do some group  
home calculations.  
We all know that a regular single-family home, four-bedroom, average around $1,750. Again,  
this could be different depending on where you're located. Everybody's number is different.  
I pulled this listing off of hard.com, a search engine, so it is a real listing in Houston. It is also in  
an economical-friendly area. This house, $1,750, is what it'll rent out for.  
Well, with group home math, if you have eight people in their house at $800 each, that's $6,400.  
Plus, of course, you want to subtract your overhead expenses, which is, of course, the rent, the  
utilities, miscellaneous. Overhead expenses for eight people in the home is generally around  
$2,550.  
How I came up with that number is the utilities, I count each person around $75, and I throw in  
about another $200 worth of miscellaneous expenses and, of course, the rent. That's how I  
came up with the $2,550. The profit for this particular home will be around $3,850.  
Annually, of one home, it'll be $46,200. Now, some of you may say, well, Lynette, you say you  
make a half a million dollars a year doing this unlicensed business, well, one house, the math  
ain't method. Well, when I teach my students how to start an unlicensed home, I do realistic  
numbers.  
With those numbers that I just showed on the group home math, that's at the bottom of the  
barrel. That's the basic of the basic, the lowest of the low numbers. How I do my group homes, I  
don't just house people who have the lowest of the low when it comes to the income and when  
it comes to the amount per bed.  
I particularly house individuals who have more Social Security VA disability or Social Security  
disability income versus SSI. The numbers that I ran just now were numbers based on SSI. SSI is  
$967 a month.  
There are a few states that gives a little bit more due to the cost of living. There are some states  
where the state will pay an additional amount to these individuals because, again, the cost of  
living. But majority of the states in the US, the rate is $967.  
Yes, from $967, the share rooms rates are anywhere between $750 to $800. You may say, well,  
Annette, that's only about $167 left for them to live off of. That ain't a lot of money.  
This is what I want you all to do. I want you all to do this exercise. This exercise is learning  
about personal needs allowance so that when you go out and start your business, you will  
understand that when it comes to a personal needs allowance, you base your rates based onthat.  
So I do need full crowd participation. Please don't crowd the chat with questions that is not  
related to what we are speaking about right now because we'll talk about those things later. So  
right now, whether you use Google, whether you use ChatGBT, whatever software it is that you  
use, I want you to ask, what is the personal needs allowance in my state?  
So whatever state you're in, put whatever the personal, what are the personal needs allowance  
in Texas or Michigan or Florida, whatever state, ask what that is so that you can know how to  
determine your rates. So let me get some full, we got 312 people on this call. I need 312 people  
responding.  
How many, what is the personal needs allowance in your state is the question. So with the  
personal needs allowance, this is what the state is telling you, how much of their income has to  
be left. All right.  
And so while y'all are doing that exercise, let me talk about the difference between some of  
these income. Let me talk about some of the differences, some of these different income  
sources. All right, so SSI.  
SSI is Supplemental Security Income. It is an income benefit for individuals who are blind,  
disabled, whether the disability is medical, physical, or mental, and or over the age of 65\. So it's  
blind, aged, or disabled.  
Those are the three qualifiers for SSI. So many of you have probably seen where inside of my  
community, I ask people to, when they out marketing, especially to people coming from prison,  
to focus on individuals who are over the age of 65\. And the reason why I say that is because  
over the age of 65 in the US, you automatically qualify for SSI.  
And you don't have to worry about trying to navigate different incomes if you focus on those  
that are 65 and older. And this is kind of like beginner level advice. There are some people who  
are incarcerated and returning home from prison, have guaranteed income that's less than the  
age of 65\.  
And I'll go into that a little bit if you are able to keep up, right? So SSDI is Social Security  
Disability Income. And with Social Security Disability Income, this is for individuals who are  
disabled.  
So they paid into Social Security, but of course became disabled, whether like I said, physically  
disabled, medically disabled, mentally disabled. Before they reach the full age of retirement. So  
they're able to pull out their money early.  
And so SSDI, it averages anywhere between $1590 to $3700. And again, this is an average. It  
could be lower or it could be much higher, but these are just some of the average numbers that  
individuals get on SSDI.And again, SSDI is Social Security Disability. They paid into Social Security at some point while  
working, met their 40 quarters, but they did not reach full retirement age. So they had to draw  
disability.  
Now, Social Security is a retirement benefit where you have to be 65 to get full Social Security,  
62 if you want to draw early Social Security. Now, with Social Security, this is the income that  
people get when they met their 40 quarters. 40 quarters is about 10 years worth of work  
history.  
This is when you, if you work a W-2 job, you'll look at your paycheck stuff and you'll see where  
you have withholdings. Withholdings from Social Security, withholdings from Medicare, and  
then of course, any other federal tax, state taxes, if you got state taxes and things like that. So  
Social Security and SSDI generates a little bit more money.  
So there are times where there are individuals that stay in my home that, let's just say for  
instance, my share rooms go up to $1,500 a month. My private rooms max out at $2,000 a  
month. So when I say I make a half a million dollars a year, or I net around $38,000 a month on  
average, it's because I'm not focused on those individuals who got SSI.  
Because SSI is the lowest of the low. That's the lowest guaranteed income you can get. So when  
I did the group home math, the numbers on the previous slide, that was for people who, you  
know, if you just only focused on SSI with that guaranteed source of income, that would be the  
only, those are realistic numbers for that.  
But the way that I do my business, of course, I target people who got more than SSI. Even like  
with the VA, right? VA disability checks.  
If they're 100%, they get $3,900 a month. If they, let's just say if they are anywhere between 50  
to 100%, right around 50, they get around about 900\. 60% goes, maybe 1,200.  
So I always tell my students, if you're going to get somebody who got a VA disability check, they  
need to have a rating of at least 50%. Anything under 50% is less than what SSI is. I mean, you  
do it, you know, you do like you want to do, but I'm telling you where the money is.  
So inside of my homes, I have, you know, a mixture of people. Some of them on SSI, some of  
them on SSDI, some of them on social security benefits, and then I have some who are  
veterans. And like I told you all, when it comes to the prison system and getting people who are  
returning home, if you want to understand other benefits, let's just say, for instance, you get a  
call and somebody is under the age of 65\.  
Well, if you start doing a deep dive and you understand working credits, you understand, you  
know, the quarters that they have to work. You understand that if they worked at least 10 years,  
they have 10 years worth of work history and not under the table methods or not working for  
yourself, but you had a W-2 job where they pulled out the money. These individuals can have  
their caseworker to go onto the social security website, put in their information, and it'll tellthem how much money they'll start drawing.  
If they had a disability rating before going into prison, when they come out of prison, their  
benefits are going to be reinstated. They'll have that same benefit, right? So these are some of  
the income sources from prison that you get from guaranteed income.  
And then, of course, you got railroad, retirement, family, private pay, pensions, and, of course,  
people who work a job. Me, I don't do the employment thing because I like to have my money  
guaranteed every month. I don't want nobody who get laid off, hours got cut, you calling in too  
much, all these different things that happen with people in the workforce.  
I just, I much rather have my guaranteed income where I have my individuals in my home, I  
have their payments drafted on auto pay, and we have nothing to worry about. The check is  
going to be there. Anything outside of that is just not my particular demographic.  
All right. And so what most people believe, you need a license to start, you need a lot of money.  
They think that it takes anywhere between 6 to 12 months to see income.  
They think you need health care experience, or you need to own real estate. And so throughout  
this presentation, you will see a few of my residents. And the reason why I have this here,  
because a lot of times people have certain mental blocks.  
They think that everybody that's in an unlicensed group home have to be physically fit, and  
that's truly not the case. When it comes to an unlicensed home, everybody has to be able to  
respond to an emergency situation independently, so no assistance from anyone else in the  
home or the owner of the house. And they have to have, they cannot have any type of cognitive  
impairments.  
But just because they have physical limitations does not mean that they do not qualify for an  
unlicensed home. All right. So, the truth is you do not need a license to begin.  
You can lease a home to get started, and you can fill your home in 30 days, and you can lunch  
without a medical background. All right. So, you're going to learn how to operate legally, serve  
the underserved demographics, and avoid red tapes and delays.  
I got three wheels.  
\[Speaker 4\]  
Yeah.  
\[Speaker 8\]  
I got three people in wheelchairs.  
\[Speaker 4\]What's up?  
\[Speaker 14\]  
What's up? I got it.  
\[Speaker 8\]  
Mendoza, don't pay him no mind.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
And so, out of the three people here that you see, two of them are actually sex offenders. Two,  
well, both the ones that are sex offenders are child sex offenders. And so, and I'm putting that  
out there because there are people who are returning home from prison that do have a sex-  
related crime.  
And you have to also understand that there are people who are returning home from prison  
that have a sex-related crime that's hard to place due to their status, as well as, you know. So,  
these, it's a huge need for people who have sex-related charges. And I do charge a premium if  
they do have a sex-related charge.  
I do charge a premium if the money is there. As you can see, the individuals that I house, they  
have a sex-related charge. They have some mobility issues.  
I don't take in anybody in my group home. They have a sex-related charge that, you know, is  
full of life. They have all of their limbs, and they're just healthy as a hog.  
Anybody that I take that have a sex-related charge typically is going to have one foot dragging  
the grave. No offense, but it's just one of my things that I, just part of my assessment. If they  
are too young and still got a lot of motion going on, I don't accept.  
If they have a lot of medical issues, physical issues, then I accept them in my home. So, all of my  
sex people that I have, they have a sex-related charge. They are disabled, and they are seniors.  
All right, so, think about it. Where other people see broken systems, you see opportunity.  
Where you see numbers, I see clients for group homes.  
So, let's do the numbers. So, what I want you to do right now is I want you to ask ChatGBT or  
Google, how many people in your city receives SSI? City or state, it doesn't matter.  
Ask how many people in your area receives SSI. And again, SSI is Supplemental Security  
Income. It is a guaranteed check as long as you are a U.S. citizen, and you are disabled, blind,  
with a disability rating of 20 over 200, or you are over the age of 65, you will receive SSI. So, ask  
right now, how many people in your state receives SSI? The data is there. All right, so, you see  
the data in your area on how many people in your area have guaranteed income.Now, ask the follow-up question. How many of these people are homeless? How many of these  
people are homeless?  
And see, the thing about doing numbers, once you understand how many people in your area  
receives guaranteed income, or people in your state have guaranteed income, you know that if  
your beds are empty, it just simply means you're not doing the work. Because where is  
somebody going to go live for $967 a month? And you may say, oh, well, you know, there's  
people on, you know, housing authority, low-income apartments, subsidized housing, things  
like that.  
Well, those individuals, those waiting lists are longer than a lot, you know, the waiting lists are  
long. They ain't going out here building out apartment complexes at the apartment complexes  
because people decide to, you know, not, you know, some against their own will are disabled,  
are seniors that didn't prepare for retirement, they didn't, you know, work under the table all  
their life, so they ain't got no money. So they don't just go out and the government is not going  
out to fund a bunch of low-income apartments because of those things.  
As y'all can see, the current administration, they trying to do whatever they can to keep poor  
people down. So it's not, they ain't, they not using a lot of government funding to go build. So  
these people are on different waiting lists, different and different homeless shelters, just, you  
know, waiting, couch surfing, going to different hospitals, you know, some of them are even in  
jail and prison due to the lack of housing.  
So when you understand the data in your area, you understand that, you know, it's not, it's not  
the program. It's not the business model. It's you, you have to market, ask how many people in  
your state return home from prison each year.  
Homeless. How many people in your state return home from prison homeless each year? We  
ain't got enough crowd participation.  
I'm watching the comments. I know who's serious about their business. All right.  
So you can feel best without being a professional marketer. You can use my referral strategy  
with social workers, access my contact scripts and directory methods and build a waiting list  
before your doors open. And when I say build a waiting list, I'm talking about a waiting list of  
different referral partners, not actual people who are homeless, because typically a waiting list  
for people who are homeless really don't exist because times something else come available,  
they're going to already be gone.  
So the right systems get you anywhere between four to $7,000 a month per home. After  
expenses, you just have to learn about different daily routines, the house manager systems,  
SOPs, and you know, your checklist for success.  
\[Speaker 14\]Watch the difference. Okay. I got you.  
All right. Okay. You get your coffee every morning like you like it?  
Very good. Yeah. We got some more coffee today.  
\[Speaker 8\]  
How are you going to help somebody? You ain't got but one leg. Shit.  
Who the fuck you talking to? Who you talking to?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
And so again, I'm just displaying some of my people in my group homes. So you all can see  
that, you know, they can be missing legs, missing both legs, you know, in wheelchairs, in  
rollators, using walkers. It does not matter.  
As long as they are able to respond to an emergency situation without the assistance, they can  
transfer, do they own toileting, you know, they ain't got to be spoon fed. They can feed  
themselves and things like that. I want you to really understand the kind of people that lives in  
these type of environments because your group home is needed.  
All right. So you have three choices. You can keep watching others win because a lot of you all  
sit on the sidelines.  
You see that the business model work, you see people, you know, posting their wins, sharing  
their stories. You can try to figure it out on your own, or you can follow a proven system that  
work. And even though I talk about how much money I make, I understand that you have the  
ability to change lives.  
This is one of my first residents. His name was Antoine. He was diagnosed with alcohol fetus  
syndrome and intellectual disabilities.  
When I first got him, of course he came out of prison looking like this on the left. He's actually,  
this is my, at the time, my personal home. This was my kitchen table after months of getting  
him stable on some medication, making sure he had a, you know, a balanced diet.  
He was able to gain 30 pounds and he was in a better space mentally overall. So you are  
definitely in the business to help people, um, help them change their lives, giving them a  
chance, giving them an opportunity. Can you imagine people who are returning home from  
prison?  
And listen, I talk about people who return home from prison, but I also have people who, you  
know, never been to prison in my group homes, but I just have a passion for individuals who  
are returning home because a lot of times, you know, society count them out. Once they gointo the dark dungeon, they pretty much, you know, off the face of the earth, let society tell it.  
So they are forgotten about and overlooked.  
But what people don't understand is, you know, these individuals, of course, you know, after  
doing 20, 30 years in prison, um, some of them, you know, actually do learn lessons, right?  
Some of them actually do settle down, had to have that sit down and understand that, you  
know, the choices that they made was stupid and they landed them there. Some of them had  
that come to Jesus moment and they do, um, deserve to have second chance opportunities.  
And then you have to also understand that people who are returning home from prison, and  
I'm not going to say a hundred percent of them, I ain't going to act like I'm just, you know, got  
to defend everybody that's walking out those gates, but I'm going to say, you know, from being  
on the inside and being on the outside, housing them, um, majority of the individuals that are  
coming home, you know, they won't, these, these men and women, they, they try to figure out  
steps and game plans, you know, what I'm going to do when I get out, I'm going to try to do  
this.  
I'm going to try to do that. They actually game plan while they in prison to try to give  
themselves a, a fighting chance when they come home. So they might be right for the most  
part.  
Um, also understand that people who are coming home from prison, especially the ones that  
make it parole, they ain't got to be granted parole. And a lot of times they don't make parole on  
a first time going up for the hearing and to talk to the parole board. So know that if somebody  
made parole, you know, they went through the justice system to be able to be granted parole,  
because again, it ain't, it ain't guaranteed for nobody.  
Um, and so they, they do a review. They look at the behaviors while they was incarcerated. Um,  
they look and see if they were being written up here, any altercations, any repeat offense.  
So trying to see if they are, um, deserving to come back into the free world. So when you make  
the decision to house returning citizens, understand that these people didn't just go break out  
of jail. They had to go in and really prove themselves to a group of people and stand up, uh,  
um, in front of a board to be able to be granted.  
All right. And so there are people right under your nose who need you. Hey, Mr. James.  
\[Speaker 9\]  
Hello.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
I just want you to just tell your story.  
\[Speaker 9\]Like how we met.  
\[Speaker 8\]  
Yeah.  
\[Speaker 9\]  
I met you down on, uh, where a piano bread, uh, well, well Fargo's bank. And, um, you asked  
me how I was doing and I told you that I was homeless. And that's how we met.  
\[Speaker 8\]  
Yeah. What did you pray for?  
\[Speaker 9\]  
I prayed that I would find a housing and, um, here I am. I found it. Or did it find you?  
I think it found me more than that. For sure. In that way.  
\[Speaker 8\]  
Okay. And also, did you know that boarding homes existed?  
\[Speaker 9\]  
Um, yes. And no, because back from where I'm from, um, the boarding homes are set, set up  
differently. They're like, um, a lot of them have like rep pays where, uh, make where they, um,  
get your checks and stuff like that.  
But I don't think you do that.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
So no, I only become the rep payee if people are, uh, incoherent and they aren't able to process  
what, you know, funds are. So basically a severe intellectual disability or a mental illness or  
some type of memory issues.  
\[Speaker 9\]  
Okay. Cool. Yep.  
Yep.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
So I don't be your payee unless, and you, you, you don't qualify for that. So no.\[Speaker 9\]  
Right. But you seem like a sweetheart lady. And no, I'm not hitting on you.  
Okay.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
All right. So I created a three part system that not just worked for me, but for others to follow  
as well. The net effect power by the group home cashflow, learn how to turn spare rooms into  
consistent cashflow and how you can too.  
So number one, of course, you know, you have to have leads, right? So leads that come in to be  
able to house people. Um, you have to convert your homes.  
You need to, you know, uh, a setup, you know, set up your room, how to set up the rooms,  
pitch to landlords or purchase a house. So homes that convert. And then of course you need to  
be able to make your business operational, setting up the business, setting up your system,  
setting up your back office, have all your own boarding documents, your full workflow.  
All right. And so lead channels, they hit referral sources. Most people overlook.  
Um, these are different counties, social services department, nonprofit housing organizations,  
veterans assistant programs, reentry organizations for formerly incarcerated individuals,  
mental health and substance abuse centers, um, social workers, discharge planners, and case  
managers. And so with different leads, these are some, some leads that I screenshotted to, uh,  
post in this presentation here on the left side, you have a nonprofit organizations. Um, they're  
right.  
It makes in 12 different States. Um, this was somebody who's also formerly incarcerated in, um,  
created a nonprofit organization, pretty much being a pen pal. and again, I need you all to  
make a memory note that this individual, right.  
People who are incarcerated in 12 different States. Right. And so he reached out to me because,  
um, there was someone who let him know that, you know, he, it was a female, let him know  
that she was up for parole.  
She didn't have a place to go. She was 68 years old. Um, he found out about me, he decided to,  
uh, you know, write me, introduce himself and give me information on the, the, the individual  
needed somewhere to stay.  
All right. So the middle one, as you can see, um, 73 old male child, sex offender will be on  
parole. So 20, 20, 30, uh, the medical wheelchair type two diabetes, COPD, asthma,  
hypertension, um, heart disease, uh, mental health status, depressive disorder.  
Um, and then of course, uh, Marine veteran with an honorable discharge. This individual, ofcourse I did take him, um, a hundred percent disabled, um, veteran. And again, like I told you  
all earlier, if it's someone who's a child sex offender, when I do my assessment, like I said, I  
want one foot dragging the grade.  
Um, and then far on the right, um, this was a lead that came in from adult protective services.  
Um, asking me, did I have any homes to accommodate him? Um, I did not accommodate  
someone with a $1,600 income for a shared room.  
It was a non-verbal veteran. My response was, I'm sure I could find somebody who can  
accommodate reason being because my occupancy rate pretty much stay at full capacity. And  
so when I cannot accommodate someone, um, in my homes, I refer the leads out to my  
mentees or other people in the area.  
All right. And so another lead is, um, this over here, another non-profit organization, uh, that  
deals with reentry. Um, good morning, Ms. We now got your information from such and such  
with a journey of a second trans ministry. Um, right on the behalf of a first cousin who was  
granted parole in October 2024, however, has not been released due to lack of housing in the  
free world. Can you please give me a call to, to discuss this matter? Right.  
And so this had been months later. Like I told y'all, there are people who are currently  
incarcerated right now. Got guaranteed.  
Um, they have to, where she calls into the intake line, my VA, of course it's train on how to do a,  
over the phone assessment. Was able to tell the, at that time patient. To notify the social  
worker.  
Gave her to email to send over me the H and P in the face sheet so that I can do a assessment  
based on the documentation. And then if the documentation. Documentation.  
Um, is okay. Then I scheduled an in-person assessment. So, the results of having lead channels  
that hit, you'll have different referrals coming in.  
So for me, I have referrals that come in various forms, whether they call, text, email, send me  
letters in the mail, fax things over, or straight to my website. The Group Home Cash Flow is how  
you get your phone ringing off the hook. All right, so next thing, you know, you want homes  
that convert.  
So, you want to make sure that you have the proper furniture that's both comfortable and  
durable, storage solutions that give residents dignity and privacy, safety equipments that meet  
all local requirements, common area arrangements that foster community while preventing  
conflicts, and then of course, maintenance systems that keep property in excellent condition. I  
have developed what I call the plug and play system. So, you can create a cozy home on a  
budget.  
I spent less than $2,500 furnishing an entire home. So, the homes, the pictures you see hereare pictures from out of my different communities. All of the furniture that I get, I get off  
Facebook Marketplace, I ask people in my neighborhood, I know what trash day is on, you  
know, the upper class areas to see what they put out.  
And so, everything is done on a budget. Used, and sometimes I get them out of thrift stores,  
and of course, I'm going to negotiate. If I see something posted on Facebook Market, I let them  
know what I'm doing.  
I let them know, yeah, I try to barter a little bit, ask for a discounted rate due to what I'm using  
it for. All right, and of course, you need to make your business operational, setting up the  
business, all the onboarding documents, your back office. You need to be able to have a system  
that brings all the way from an initial referral and all the way down to the day they move in.  
And so, here, I just put in one of my general flyers. And of course, these are real pictures from  
my group homes. So, when I send out my general flyer, they can have a visual of my home.  
So, you need systems in place from setting up your business structure, creating a digital  
footprint, getting leads to the door, and managing residents in the home. I have created every  
document needed to pitch to landlords, scripts for your different cold calls, and sending out  
emails. So, when you combine the three components that we went over, the lead channels that  
hit, homes that convert, and making your business operational, that's what you call the net  
effect.  
So, if you can see yourself benefiting from the cash flow strategy, put a yes in the chat.  
\[Speaker 2\]  
No Fluff Real Testimonial. Shout out to Lynette Wheaton for showing me and hundreds of other  
people her unlicensed group home share living model that has allowed me to become a  
successful operator to the point that I was able to leave my 9 to 5 job. And not only that, this  
unlicensed group home model has allowed me to use it to facilitate me to get to my unlicensed  
youth group home that I am currently working on as we speak.  
So, I just want to say, Lynette, appreciate you for this model. I did not even know this model  
existed until I met you. And when I seen you doing what you was doing, I'm like, oh yeah, this is  
a great way to get in to not only create generational wealth for myself and my family, but to  
impact those who are in need in the community.  
\[Speaker 13\]  
So, I'm Dee in Charlotte, North Carolina. I just want to let you know that if you have not already  
purchased your ticket to next conference group home for newbies, you are missing out. The  
gems that they drop are amazing.  
Like, money cannot afford it. Seriously. So, if you haven't already purchased, if you haven'talready purchased your ticket and there are no more slots available, then you need to contact  
her for consultation because she is the bomb.com.  
Thank you guys.  
\[Speaker 11\]  
Hi, everybody. I'm Justin. I'm from Milwaukee.  
I came all the way here to Charlotte to learn from the group homes for newbies conference. It  
was fantastic. There was so much learning over the last two days.  
My fingers are sore from trying to type out all the notes on my laptop. I had the voice recorder  
going. It was raining gold nuggets everywhere.  
So, definitely got a lot of information to change my business with and do things that I've been  
wanting to do with it. And you can have the same thing too. So, there's probably very limited  
seats left at the remaining conferences.  
You need to get signed up for them if you're at all serious about this business. Thank you.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
So, the net effect, launch your first group home in 45 days without owning properties, without  
getting licensed, or guessing what to do next. So, here's what you'll get. So, I have a very  
detailed course.  
There's, of course, the core training step-by-step videos, lead scripts, the house setup guide,  
onboarding templates, the landlord goldmine bonus, and a 30-day game plan bonus. Valued at  
$5,082, today only $997. Start for as low as $65 a month with the buy now, pay later options.  
And so, I also provide a money back guarantee. If you do the work and it doesn't pay off, I'll  
refund you, but you got to show up and apply it. And so, now I got another exercise for us to  
do.  
So, this is one of the things that, this is the reason why I can offer a money back guarantee,  
because I know that my system works. So, I want you to ask ChatGPT, how many social workers  
are in my state? And put that in the chat.  
How many social workers in my state? I want you to see how many social workers are in your  
state. I need full participation.  
And, of course, if anybody want to log out, that's totally fine. If, you know, we've been on here  
for a while, but I have more exercises for you to kind of understand the numbers in your state  
and how to, you know, make sure that when you start building up your roster for people who  
have leads for you, you need to understand how many people it is. And the reason why I say inyour state is because when you are looking for residents, people come from all over.  
You need to build, cast a wide net. And so, I have a gym that I'm finna get ready and drop. So, I  
like when I get to this part and people start leaving, because I always say the best for last.  
So, the next exercise is, I want you to go on medicare.gov. Medicare.gov. So, now that we see  
about how many social workers in our state, we already know that people that refer us, people  
are social workers, discharge planners, case managers, reentry, parole officers, probation  
officers. You know, you market to different federal prisons, state prisons, state jails, county jails.  
There's so many people that you can market to and share my marketing strategies with.  
So, I know that this business works. I live by it. I do it every day.  
I know that if you're putting in the work, you're gonna get the results. All right. So, the next  
exercise I want you to do, I want you to go to medicare.gov. Medicare.gov. Type that in.  
Medicare.gov. On medicare.gov, I want you to go to the top and say, it says find providers.  
Medicare.gov. Let me know when you there. Let me know when you at medicare.gov, so we can  
move on. I don't want to leave nobody behind. All right. Now, click on providers and services.  
Click on providers and services. After you click on providers and services, I want you to go to  
find care providers. So, the first steps, go to medicare.gov, find providers. So, once you find the  
care providers, I want you to click on hospitals. Click on hospitals. And so, when you click on  
hospitals, just type in your city.  
Whatever city or whatever major city in your area, type that in and then hit search. And what I  
like to tell my students, I let them know that when you are looking at different, you know, when  
you searching, you want to be out like at least a 50 mile radius, 58 mile radius. So, you got to  
cast a wide net.  
So, with the hospitals, y'all, people get discharged from the hospital all the time with no place to  
go. That's one of the places that we market. Go to nursing homes.  
I know I'm probably going fast, but you will see where you got nursing homes, hospitals,  
dialysis clinics, rehabs. Listen, when you build up your referral list, medicare.gov, you pull all  
this data out and everything that I teach you in the course, you're going to call all of these  
people. So, you ain't even got to pay nobody to do no kind of data scrapping for you.  
And a lot of these people aren't even on Google. So, they don't even have websites. So, you  
wouldn't even know certain people in your area exist, certain facilities, certain doctor's offices,  
even like the primary care doctors and clinicians, all of them.  
So, I done gave y'all a way to be able to pull data in your own area. And all of these people, and  
I mean every last one of them, have people who needs to be in shared living homes. This is the  
data.And this is just one component. Inside of my course, I go over several different components  
where you can find people. But that's the reason why I say, if you do the work and it don't work,  
then I give your money back.  
Because, you know, you must live in a ghost town. But if you follow my systems, you follow the  
scripts, you do your follow-ups, everything that I teach you is going to work for you. All right.  
And so, I also will be throwing in bonuses for those of you who are ready to act and build a  
business that make money while making a difference. Bonus number one, my first 30 days  
action plan. A day-by-day checklist that tell you exactly what to do from the moment you join  
until your very first resident.  
Bonus number two, my e-book on how to do a market analysis, how to find exactly what's  
needed in your area. And understand, with a market analysis, going on medicare.gov, that's  
one way to do a market analysis. What a market analysis essentially is, is to find the need in  
your area.  
Find the people that, you know, are underserved. Which areas are the most underserved? So  
you can, if you haven't already gotten a house, you're able to figure out what areas you need to  
be in, you know, to put that house in that area.  
So the full market analysis. Listen, doing a market analysis is essential for all business. You  
don't, you don't just go out and jump off the porch and open a business without understanding  
what the need is in your area.  
All right. And so, bonus number three, a lifetime update to all my material.  
\[Speaker 22\]  
Hallelujah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hallelujah, prayer, hallelujah. I keep on walking with my  
mind all in it.  
\[Speaker 14\]  
I keep on walking with my mind.  
\[Speaker 8\]  
Well, I'm sure glad you woke up with your mind on me so you could put these desk together. I  
thought they said you only had one desk left to do. I got two.  
\[Speaker 14\]  
Well, well, take that.  
\[Speaker 8\]No, I told you, I told you I was coming to get you today.  
\[Speaker 14\]  
Oh, honey, I don't want to be with you. I'm taking care of your people. It's my off day too.  
I ain't got to do shit. I ain't doing shit for nobody. The boss that y'all, y'all get lost and get back.  
I'm gonna be with my woman. I'm not doing nothing. It's my off day.  
I don't get no off day. My baby gotta help me get off day. I'm so glad she's back with me.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
And Harold is one of my field house managers. So he's not just the house manager at his home.  
He responds to all of my homes.  
And one thing about growing your business, all of my homes are in the same zip code for  
convenience purposes so that if, you know, another house needs some strength or support, I  
just send somebody else from a different home and send in the support. I don't go to my  
homes very often. Maybe once or twice a month because a lot of things that is handled is  
handled by my house manager.  
Um, so yeah. So when I teach you how to build this business, it's not for you to be working, you  
know, working. Self-employed is designed to have systems in place so your business to run  
without you.  
So of course, bonuses for action takers, that's an additional $13.91 in value, but free for those  
who take action. Tell him you want to go to your sister's house. Harold, he want to go to his  
sister's house.  
\[Speaker 8\]  
I broke it to him. I would have broke it to him.  
\[Speaker 14\]  
So if she don't want him, what you got to do?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
He was on the street. I'm not putting him back on the street. He just gonna have to fight with  
me.  
\[Speaker 14\]  
Fight with who?\[Speaker 4\]  
You.  
\[Speaker 18\]  
I can handle it. I hope he can. My hair caught now.  
\[Speaker 8\]  
You mean tell your brother your hair is cut?  
\[Speaker 18\]  
Yeah.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
I had to get him, I had to send a picture. You see yourself?  
\[Speaker 18\]  
Yeah.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
You look handsome.  
\[Speaker 18\]  
Yeah.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
You glad you got your hair cut?  
\[Speaker 18\]  
Yeah.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
That's good. I'm gonna bring you a watch tomorrow.  
\[Speaker 18\]  
I miss my dog, man.  
\[Speaker 1\]You miss your dog?  
\[Speaker 18\]  
Yeah.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
We'll have to get you another one.  
\[Speaker 18\]  
Yeah, you just get me a dog while I'm here, man.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
You need me to get you a dog over here?  
\[Speaker 18\]  
Yeah. Okay. Where's his dog, man?  
He come take care of. I told you he was sick. Oh, man.  
My back. Head. His dog old, man.  
Mm-hmm.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
So this is a guy that I got from Adult Protective Services. He was living homeless in an empty  
field with two dogs. Uh, so far he's been with me for two years.  
So most times when you do your assessments and you catch a lot of things up front, you will be  
able to determine if somebody's gonna be long-term or if they gonna be, you know, they ain't  
gonna be that long. So you'll be able to determine. And so like this guy, of course, he wasn't  
somebody who was coming home from prison.  
I got him from the community. So understand that there's people right in your community that  
need housing. And then there's people who are incarcerated that needs housing.  
And I need you to understand that when there's people who are incarcerated, it comes from  
four different places. It comes from state prisons, federal prisons, state jails, and county jails.  
When you are marketing to your state, don't try to just look for prisons that's close by your city.  
In the state, they can discharge wherever. They'll just sign them up for the local parole office.  
So don't think that, oh, you know, that prison is up north.No, if you got a bed, they gonna discharge a parole to that city or that county and they gonna  
sign them up for their local parole officer. So don't think that, you know, just because  
somebody ain't in your back door that you can't have them. Same thing with federal prison.  
We don't have federal prisons in all 50 states. People that commit crimes in different states  
have to go to the handful of federal prisons that's in the United States. So when you're  
marketing to the federal prisons, don't think that, oh, since this federal prison ain't in my state,  
I can't market there.  
No, they will put them at the nearest parole office in that state. Same thing with state jail. State  
jail and federal...  
State jail and state prison is two different things. The other thing that may be limited to your  
area is people who are on probation. It's the difference between parole and probation.  
Probation is county. And when it comes to the county, then they usually, if they have a  
probation officer, they have to stick around, stick right there. They can't just travel throughout  
the state.  
All right. So again, your price today is only $9.97 with the money back guarantee. Here's just a  
few reviews that people have shared.  
All right. And so one more thing that I want to be able to share with you all, because again, I  
like for people to fall off, right? Um, when I dropped my gems.  
So earlier I told you to make a mental note of that guy who wrote from 12, you know, wrote 12  
different prisons. Um, and the reason why I told you to make that mental note is because I  
teach my students, you know, in order to be able to bypass, let's just say that the caseworkers,  
the re-entry coordinators, the warden secretary, when they not really getting your information,  
or they may say, you know, give you some hard times. You are able to write people who are  
incarcerated directly, just like the guy who write 12 different prisons in the country.  
Right? You can do the same thing. Um, you also can request what is called, you know,  
information from the prison system.  
You can request the information of people who are up for parole. You can request the  
information from people who, um, has already made parole, but are still incarcerated using the  
Freedom of Information Act. It is a federal act.  
So with the Freedom of Information Act, you can request, um, you know, the data to be able to  
write these individuals directly. On everybody's Department of Corrections website, there is,  
um, a way for you to do what they call an inmate search. With the inmate search, basically, you  
will be, um, searching them by their first and last name, or their, um, offender ID number.  
And so when you search them by their information, you will be able to get what unit they're on,what's all the way down to their bunk number, and you can write them. So there's a plenty of  
ways that I teach my students to take the back door to be able to find those individuals who are  
over the age of 65, find those individuals that have guaranteed income, write them directly.  
Hey, I see that you're up for parole.  
I'm not sure if you, you know, have an address to make parole to, but I have Second Chance  
Housing here in the Houston metro area. Um, you know, I would love for you to be able to, um,  
parole to my house. If you don't have a place to go, here's my contact information.  
Looking forward to hearing back from you soon. You know, just getting your information into  
the prison. Because one thing about the men, one thing about the women, they gonna spread  
the word like wildfire because they all are dealing with the same struggles.  
They all have to lean on one another for resources and support because of course, the CEOs,  
they don't care, you know, administration, they don't care. They are in their eyes, you know,  
these are people who are unworthy of a second chance, unworthy of an opportunity. They just  
there for a check.  
So I teach my students how to take the back door. Um, and essentially, you know, that's how  
you keep your beds filled. So that's why I say, as long as you follow all of my strategies,  
everything that I teach you, you will be fine, um, starting and scaling your business.  
If you are a lazy operator, you don't market your business. You don't follow up. You don't send  
out emails.  
You don't, you just don't follow the market, marketing strategy is not going to work for you.  
And the ones that it don't work for, I say, Hey, you know, I'm a, I'm a jump on Zoom with you.  
Um, share your screen.  
I want to see how many emails you sending out. I want to see the content. Oh, I ain't sent no  
emails out.  
Okay. You're not doing the work. So as long as you follow the plan, the plan is going to work for  
you.  
If you, if you lazy and you think that something is just gonna follow your lap, it's not gonna  
work for you. It's just that simple. You see the data.  
I purposely put the data out there so that you all can see the need in your area. You can see the  
numbers. You just got to go out and get it.  
So the link is in the chat. You can secure your spot. Let's change some lives together, starting  
with yours.  
Um, and thank you all for being here today. Now I will take, I would say the first 10 questions,  
um, because I do have an early flight tomorrow because I have a speaking engagement, um, inAtlanta, Georgia. So I do have to cut out here early, um, for that.  
Um, Hey, Ms. Bell. Hold on. Let me let you unmute.  
Let me give me a second. Okay, Ms. Bell, you should be able to unmute.  
\[Speaker 10\]  
All right. Thank you for taking my call. The one question I have is, is your process related to still  
having to go through zoning and approval from the city or are you bypassing that by doing the  
two LOCs and just getting a lease and then the company does that?  
Cause that's where I'm getting held up at is the city is asking me for all the zoning stuff.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Where are you located? I'm in Columbus, Ohio. So for the most part, when we dealing with  
people who, um, follow under the fair housing act, um, they can't have, they don't, they, they  
can't enforce, um, you know, that on them because these individuals are protected, a protected  
class.  
\[Speaker 10\]  
But I mean, I like, I have a mortgage on the home and they're saying I need to get it rezoned to  
be able to house unrelated people.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Right. But they probably did that because you went up there asking questions that you didn't  
know the full, you know, exactly what you was asking. So to, you know, a regular shared living  
home with, you know, people who are unrelated, then of course they have those restrictions.  
But when it comes to people who have, you know, following the fair housing act, um, you just  
get started unless you have permitting where, um, they have like, you know, boarding home  
permits, lodging, uh, permits or rooming permits. But, um, just to rezone your house, people  
that follow under the, uh, fair housing, um, act can live wherever they want to live.  
\[Speaker 10\]  
Yeah. They're saying I gotta do a rooming permit and then get approval to make sure the  
house is zoned.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
So you have to see it. Um, Mr. I think, well, uh, Jay, Jay Brumfield.  
\[Speaker 16\]Hello. Thank you so much. Um, I saw your post like one minute before you went live.  
So that was good. And this was good. And, um, two questions.  
Whenever, well, do your landlords ever worry about like, if the house and stuff will be messed  
up? And the second one is where will you be in Atlanta? Cause I'm in the area.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
So as far as the landlord, when we negotiate with the landlord, we let them know that we have  
a maintenance, um, on staff. So if anything is, um, destroyed, of course we fix it as, you know,  
we, we don't just trash their house. So we let them know, um, that when we negotiate.  
And then as far as, uh, where I'm gonna be, um, I'm not sure where the, uh, conference is. I  
have the address, but I don't know what part of town it is, but it's, um, it's a, uh, affordable  
housing summit that, um, Eddie Charger is throwing inside of Atlanta. Um, the 13th and the  
14th, two days.  
\[Speaker 23\]  
Okay.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
You're welcome. Ashley Thomas, miss Ashley, Joe Watkins. You still muted Joe.  
\[Speaker 4\]  
Sorry. Can you hear me now?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
I can hear you.  
\[Speaker 4\]  
All right. Good evening. Um, the presentation was, was great.  
Um, I've been following for a while and think this is kind of right on point, but not sure if I'll be  
able to take advantage of the opportunity that I have right now with it. I have a, um, because  
the thing is I have a three unit building, but it's in Chicago and it has stairs even to the first  
floor. So didn't know if I'd be able to take advantage of it with the same type of clientele that  
you have, um, due to possible restrictions because of stairs.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Yeah, it is one of those things that, you know, um, you have to be mindful of. Now, I do have  
many people who are able to walk up the stairs, but the thing about it is, um, of course, if you,you limit yourself, not to say it can't be done, but as leads come in, if they have some mobility  
issues, of course, you know, that that's a lead that you can take because of that.  
\[Speaker 4\]  
Okay. And do you have any, um, um, mentees who are operating in the city of Chicago?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Yeah, I just did a two-day conference in Chicago as well.  
\[Speaker 4\]  
Okay. All right, because I think there's the timing, I guess I'll be limited, but, um, the timing,  
timing kinds of work out because right now I have a three unit building. Deer repairs and  
everything is actually moving and it's actually looking for tenants and it's just kind of been slow.  
So I have two vacant units and the current tenant is moving out in October. So I have two units  
that's available. I already have a business that's set up, haven't taken advantage of it, but it is  
set up properly.  
And after watching the presentation, I just thought I'd be limited myself because I won't be able  
to access some of the same type of clients that you have.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Yeah. Like I said, um, I mean, people, some of them are mobile, some of them are not. So, um, I  
mean, you still need to figure out how to cash flow your property.  
So, um, the, the only way to cash flow and get the max amount of returns is to house people  
who of course are open to sharing a room because there's no other method in an unlicensed  
space where you will make massive returns on a property, um, like, like my strategy.  
\[Speaker 4\]  
Okay.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
So you do need to figure out, you know, how you going to work that out.  
\[Speaker 4\]  
Okay. And signing up for your program will show me the steps to do that myself.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Yes.\[Speaker 4\]  
Okay. I'll be, um, I'll be signing up tonight then.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Okay.  
\[Speaker 4\]  
Thank you.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
You're welcome. Miss Karen.  
\[Speaker 19\]  
Yeah. Hello.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Hey, how you doing?  
\[Speaker 19\]  
I'm good. I'm great. I just want to know when you're coming to New Orleans.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Oh, I have no plans on coming to New Orleans. We are having a meetup in Houston, which is  
about six hours away. Um, it's not really possible for us to go, you know, state to state to state.  
Um, whenever, whenever there's, um, some in-person events, we post them and we just  
encourage people to, you know, make their way if possible.  
\[Speaker 19\]  
Okay. I thought I saw something saying that you were going to Florida, then New Orleans or  
something. I missed it.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Yeah, but it's not. Yeah. I'm going to, um, to a text conference in New Orleans.  
\[Speaker 19\]  
Okay. All right. So you are going to be able to put something else.All right. Thank you.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
You're welcome. Miss, um, Valencia. Yes.  
Valencia. Hi, how are you?  
\[Speaker 7\]  
I'm fine. How are you? This is my second time on the zoom with you and I really appreciate  
what you do.  
And, and I'm doing my due diligence. I'm in Delaware. So I've been researching getting things  
together.  
I have a partner that is not able to start with me until November. I wanted to know two things.  
Um, do you have any dates set for 2026 in-person dates?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
No, ma'am. Not yet. We usually, uh, try to brainstorm that in, um, November.  
\[Speaker 7\]  
Okay. The second thing I wanted to know is how do you feed your, your, your residents? Do  
they buy food on their own or how does that work as far as their meal plan food stamps, food  
stamps, and then they kind of like just share together and you kind of just buy everything for  
the whole house.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
No, they, they Walmart delivery.  
\[Speaker 7\]  
Okay. And that's, that's something that you do or they do. They do.  
Okay. All right. So you don't have to feed them or supply any food.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
No, I also have a non-medical home care agency. So if anybody need assistance, I use my  
second business to give them a caregiver to go in the house to assist. Okay.  
\[Speaker 7\]  
I have a home care agency as well in Pennsylvania. So I wanted to kind of cross those together,but thank you for answering my question.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
You're welcome. Hey, Kiki.  
\[Speaker 20\]  
Hey, thank you for coming on here. Um, when I say you drop them, you really drop gems, but  
my question for you, um, does this fall under like a nonprofit?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
No, ma'am. It's a for-profit.  
\[Speaker 20\]  
Okay. All right.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Thank you. You're welcome. Miss Victoria.  
\[Speaker 15\]  
Hi, thank you so much for the opportunity. I really appreciate the zoom. Um, I just had a  
question, um, cause I was gonna, I saw you had in your TikTok bio, a zoom that was two hours  
that we could purchase.  
I'm just trying to see like, what was the difference? Um, like what we would get from that, um,  
that replay.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Yeah. So that one is, um, uh, replay on housing, returning citizens, just giving you information  
on that particular demographic, whereas the course is the A to Z of the full business, um, and  
multiple demographics.  
\[Speaker 15\]  
Okay. Thank you so much.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Miss Paulette Edwards.  
\[Speaker 3\]  
Can you hear me?\[Speaker 1\]  
I can.  
\[Speaker 3\]  
Okay. Hi. Um, and thank you so much.  
Um, I've been, um, looking into this and I've been wanting to do, uh, something like this. Um,  
right now I have a daycare and I also have a nonprofit and then, uh, but I was looking into  
doing this and, um, could I use my nonprofit and my daycare to coincide with something like  
this or, you know, like if, um, like some of the women, if they're trying to, I guess, reunite with  
their kids or get their kids back, you know, if they're younger women, um, but I know you were  
saying mostly deal with 65 and older.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Because you have to understand where they're going to get their money from.  
\[Speaker 3\]  
Right. Right. Okay.  
And then, um, I was now here in Alabama. Um, I've noticed that there's like a hotel that's been  
like, it's a one level. Um, and it's been vacant for like years and years.  
What, could I use something like that for this?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Yes. A vacant hotel.  
\[Speaker 3\]  
Yeah. It's like one level, you know, how you have like, um, um, you see them, it's like, uh, just  
one level, but it's like, um, I guess kind of like a plaza style, you know, and it's like four or five,  
you know, buildings, but they have, you know, the different rooms, uh, would I be able to,  
what's your vision on that versus a regular house? Oh, I was wondering, would I be able to use  
something like that?  
You know, that's my, that's, um, what I was thinking. Could I use that for, you know, housing or  
would I just need to stick with a regular house?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
It's probably going to be simple to just use it. Cause once you start getting commercial  
buildings, it get a little bit more complicated.\[Speaker 3\]  
Oh, okay. Okay. I see what you're saying.  
Okay. And then, uh, I'm going to sign up for your course as well. Um, but thank you so very  
much.  
Oh, um, do you do like, uh, private conversations with people?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Okay.  
\[Speaker 3\]  
Okay. Would I just message you to see whatever day and time you have available?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Yeah, I have a link. If you message me, um, I can see on Facebook, I can send you my link. Okay.  
\[Speaker 3\]  
Okay. I'll do that then. I'll send you a message and then you could just send me the link.  
Thank you so very much.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
You're welcome.  
\[Speaker 3\]  
Okay. Bye.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Okay. Bye. Hey, Miss Laquita, Miss Laquita Pickett.  
\[Speaker 12\]  
Hey, hi, how are you?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
I'm fine. How are you?  
\[Speaker 12\]  
Okay. So my question was regarding like the permit. I wanted to know, um, have you everencountered, uh, landlords who don't allow setting up furnishing the home under the letter of  
intent specifically for inspection purposes?  
I'm not really understanding. I read something about the home had to be furnished in order to  
pass the inspection. What inspection?  
Um, for like the permit. What city? In Harris County.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
So why wouldn't a landlord, you let the landlord know from the beginning what your intent to  
use the property for?  
\[Speaker 12\]  
Okay.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
So you don't, you don't go and start renting a house without them understanding what your  
intention is for their property.  
\[Speaker 12\]  
Gotcha. Okay. That's what I wanted to make sure.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Okay.  
\[Speaker 12\]  
Thank you.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Mr. Wiles.  
\[Speaker 15\]  
See my hair, he might have.  
\[Speaker 5\]  
Hello, uh, Lynette. First off, um, I want to say thank you. And that I'm proud of you because you  
understood the assignment when you was, uh, when you was in the correctional office as an  
officer, uh, you, you, you had to be part of the process of correction.  
So, uh, you came up with, you came up with a process to help. So, uh, I'm proud of you. Thankyou.  
And, um, I just purchased the course.  
\[Speaker 24\]  
Okay.  
\[Speaker 5\]  
And I, I got a pop-up saying that, um, what it said, I will receive the material in 45 days. Is it a  
way for me to, uh, speak that up?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
No, it's, it's, uh, what, what name did you purchase it under?  
\[Speaker 5\]  
It's under Demetria wall.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
So you should check your spam.  
\[Speaker 5\]  
Let me see. I was looking at, uh, what it was showing on the screen. It say, uh, you receive a  
course along with documents needed to get your business started in 45 days.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
No. So getting start getting your business started in 45 days, not the course, getting it in 45  
days. Check your email.  
\[Speaker 5\]  
Okay. I'll check it.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
No, check it right now.  
\[Speaker 5\]  
All right. Let's do it. Okay.  
Yup. I see it here. Okay.Bonus and course documents are inside the receipt. Group home cash flow. Yup.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Okay. And then after you get, after you get done with everything, of course, um, it's a lot to  
digest. So what I always tell people as they going through the course, cause it's like a little bit  
over four hours, um, by 65 modules.  
Um, and of course they got quizzes in there to help you for, you know, for you to make sure you  
understand what I'm trying to get you to understand during that module. But of course, if you  
don't have, if you have questions or need clarity, the email that you received the course from,  
like, as you're going through it, right. And, um, write all your questions down and then, uh,  
schedule a response to the email with your questions.  
\[Speaker 5\]  
Okay. Okay.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Okay.  
\[Speaker 5\]  
Thank you.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
You're welcome. Ms. Robertson.  
\[Speaker 6\]  
Hi. Yes. Um, thank you so much for, um, doing this.  
Um, I have like three questions. So I noticed that you have men and women in the videos. Um,  
do you house them together or separately?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Yeah, I do have co-ed homes.  
\[Speaker 6\]  
Co-ed. Okay. So that is a thing.  
Okay. And then as far as like, um, I know you say you kind of want one foot in the grave when it  
comes to certain, um, certain tenants, do you medically transport them? Like, can you add that  
as like a second business to your?\[Speaker 1\]  
Yeah, you can, um, a separate entity and non-emergency medical transportation.  
\[Speaker 6\]  
Okay. Awesome. And then, um, just kind of like your opinion, why do you prefer unlicensed  
over licensed?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
Because with the unlicensed model, it's easier to get started less regulations. Um, I'm able to,  
um, get paid from the housing portion. And then of course, when I opened up my non-medical,  
uh, non, uh, non-medical home care agency, um, I'm able to Medicaid, um, to send in  
caregivers to assist them as well.  
So, um, it's, I mean, as you can see in my unlicensed model with my seven homes, I average  
around 38 to $40,000 a month, and I don't have to have staff, right. Staffing ratios, certain, um,  
you got to do certain activities with them. The state can come in on you at any time.  
So it's just a little bit more relaxed and easier to get started. Um, I don't have to invest in a fire  
suppression system, um, you know, and things like that. So that's why.  
\[Speaker 6\]  
Okay. And then lastly, so I own my home. I have like four bedrooms.  
My master takes up the whole side of the house. Um, but the only issue is like, it's the upstairs.  
So kind of like the other guy was saying, like, is this something that I should pursue or like only  
just stay with one level homes?  
\[Speaker 1\]  
No. So my house, when I had my people in my house, my, my house was, um, my, my master  
was downstairs where I slept. And then the three, the six people was upstairs.  
So there's, there's plenty of people, um, you know, that don't have mobility issues that can go  
upstairs.  
\[Speaker 6\]  
Okay. Awesome. Awesome.  
Well, thank you so much. Oh, and wait, oh, one more question. Can I get your package with like  
client or something?  
Cause I don't have like 900 right now.\[Speaker 1\]  
Yes. So if you click the link, you'll see Klorna and Afterpay.  
\[Speaker 2\]  
Oh, perfect. Okay. Thank you.  
\[Speaker 1\]  
You're welcome. All right, y'all. Um, I got a 4am flight, so I have to skate out of here.  
Um, the course is very detailed. So a lot of your questions, um, are already there provided for  
you. Um, we'll try to do like a Q and a meeting at some point, maybe next week, just to do like a  
quest, a question to answer for those of you who are new and still have, um, you know, some  
uncertainties about the business.  
Um, I look forward to working with you. If you all decide to move forward, um, with this  
business model, if right now isn't the time for you, um, you know, just still stick around because  
inside group homes for newbies, we talk about multiple streams of income, not just, you know,  
the group home model. We talk about other wraparound services.  
We, um, talk about different funding opportunities for those of you that don't have, um, the  
money right away to get started. Um, and you know, other business ventures. So it's not always  
about just the group home model.  
You just have to stay connected, um, understanding that, you know, you can be successful in  
this space. Um, and we teach you exactly what you need. And like William alluded to earlier, um,  
inside the group and group homes for newbies on Facebook, there is a search bar at the top of  
the page.  
You can type in different keywords and read different posts that we've talked about in the past.  
The group has been around for two years. So I'm sure that, you know, whatever questions that  
you may have, somebody has probably asked them already.  
Um, you'll be able to type in your city in the chat. You'd be able to type in your state to see what  
other people in your area have, you know, are talking about. So there's just so much already in  
the group.  
But of course, if you need, um, more of a structure, um, assistance, um, of course I have my  
course, but I also have mentorship options as well. If you want to view those offers, I will type  
those in the chat for those of you that, um, you know, don't want to just do the core self pace.  
We also have mentorship available and it's just the name of the group, uh, the website,  
www.grouphomesfornewbies.com.  
So y'all have a good night. You do the same. You do the same.Thank you.  
\[Speaker 6\]  
Thank you.  
\[Speaker 12\]  
Thank you so much. Thank you. Good night.  
\[Speaker 15\]  
Thank you. Good night.  
\[Speaker 7\]

\[Speaker 12\]  
Thank you.  
\[Speaker 23\]  
Good night.  
\[Speaker 17\]  
Smell of it. Mama\!
